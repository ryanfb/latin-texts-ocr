 LIFE OF GATULLUS.

 ,μ-

 VALERIUS CATULLUS was a native of Verona or of some place
 in its immediate neighbourhood. It is doubtful whether his
 praenomen were Caius (A uleius, A log. vol. p. 12:Bi-
 pont. ed.) or Quintus (P iny, H. . xxxvii. 6). His father

 was born in n.c. 87, and died in, or shortly after, n.c.p‹l)7.
 He went at an early age to Rome, probably for the purpose of
 ἷὲζίἒ Ῑξῗέξεῆξ, 6311?? ’.ιαὲιῖοἳῖῗ ä?“ ζῇῗίῗῖ 31103.3 οὲἰῗ ’3ῗὲ
 beautiful promontory of Sirmio, on the s ores of the lake Be-
 nacus (Lago di Garda), he had a country house at Tibur (Ti-
 voli), _a house or at least a artments at Rome, and was the
 owner of a acht, in which e made a voyage from Pontus to
 Italy. (See oemat. iv., xxxi., xxxv., xliv., lxviii.)

 In the capital Catullus mingled with the gayest society, and
 as a natural consequence, became deepl involved in debts. To
 repair broken fortunes by plundering the provincials was then
 the usual resource of Roman rodigals; and, for this purpose,
 Catullus accompanied Caius emmiu, the friend of the con-
 temporary poet Lucretius, to his prmtorian province of Bithy-
 nia. Either Memmius suffered no one but himself to rob the
 Bithynians, or the province had been exhausted by previous
 exactions, and the poet returned to Rome “ with a purse full
 of cobwebs” (xx, xiii., xxviii., xlvii.), and exsecrating the ri-

 our or the stinginess of his chief. His Bithynian expedition,

 indeed, aﬂ'orded him an opportunity of visiting the most re-

 nowned cities of Greece and the Lesser Asia (xlvi.). During

 the voyage, a brother, whom Catullus speaks of in his poems

 with unaffected grief, is said to have died and to have been

 buried in the Troad. Still poor, and still attached to egpensiva
 n

 4 msa or cunnus.

 habits and company, Catnllus survived his return to -Italy a
 few years, dying, it is supposed, after he had completed his
 fortieth birthday (xxvi., xxxviii.. lx.).

 The lady whom Catullus celebrates in so many of his verses
 under the name of Lesbia, was, we are told b Apuleius (Apo-
 log. vol. p. l2: Bipont. ed.), a Clodia o the great Clau-
 dian house. But that she was, as has been assumed, the no-
 torious sister of Clodius, the turbulent tribune, slain by Milo
 in n.c. 58, is improbable. The poet’s compliment to Cicero,
 whom he styles “ Optimus Patronus ” (xlix.), would not have
 been palatable to a lady whom the orator had incensed by his
 ﬁerce invectives and scurrilous jests (Cicero, Pro Coelio, 8,
 rs, etc.). The associates of Catullus were such men as the
 youn er Curio and Antonius; yet, there are many roofs
 that e was intimate with worthier persons, and indee with
 some of the most eminent literary and political characters of the
 time, e.g. M. Cicero, and therefore perhaps with Atticus also,
 with Alphenus Vinus, they advocate, with Licinius Calvus, a
 distinguished orator poet, with Cinna, the-author of the
 £3§§§s.°“liii ωἷᾚῖἔξῗωῗὲῗὲἒῖἑὲ ῧῷἳῗοὲἲὶζέᾘὲἓὶἳιῖἳῖ
 unknown, and hi' hostility is the more strange, since the elder
 Catullus was among the Dictator’s intimate friends, and the
 Romans were a ’t to love and to hate according to the preju-‘
 dices which they inherited. ’His rancour was indeed temporary,
 and in some ’poenis (see xi; 19) Catullus seems inclined tol

 Perhaps, as heineluded in his censure the Dictator’s partisans, l
 especiallyhis* master of the ordnance, L. Mamurra (xxix.,
 lvii.), his feelings ¹may have been as much political as personal.
 His attack on* Caesar, however, produced no unpleasant cons
 quences either to the poet himself pr his family. The ancient
 were, in our estimation, singularly callous to abuse in speec
 ’ or writing. Caesar was among the inest placable of men, an

 the Augustan poet, more properly belongs to Catullus. In
 some respects also he, rather than Virgil, merits the praise of
 having reﬁned and diﬁiﬁed the Roman hexameter, since his ‘
 poem entitled ‘The arriage-Song of Peleus and Thetis’
 (lxiv.) is for vigour, majesty and sweetness nearly on a level
 with the smooth and stately measure of the Georgics and
 Eneid. Tibullus and Ovid both assign to Catullus the epi-
 thet of doctus, and its cause and propriety have given rise to
 much discussion among commentators. If it were bestowed
 upon him on account of his intimate acquaintance with Greek
 literature, doctus would be equally pertinent to Propertius,
 whose style was modelled on that of the Alexandrian versi-
 ﬁers, and who aspired to be the “Roman Callimachus.”

 The extant works of Catullus consist in all of one hundred
 and sixteen pieces‘of various kinds, and with scarcely any ar-
 ῒζῗιῖὲἷοῗῖ Ῐὲἳῗ, Ξῖ ’ἱῖῗὲῗξὶοξὶῖῗῖιὲἷὲζὲἔίεὲξῖ milk?
 lation of a lost poem of Callimachus; and the residue belongs
 to that order of composition which the ancients termed Epi-
 grams, ale. brief sententious pieces, with or without a satiri-
 cal point, often simply commemorative of an incident or a
 feeling.. Of the ‘Atys,’ his master-work, we shall speak pre-
 liminary to the extract from it. It is probable that many of
 the poems of Catullus have been lost'c mere vers de société,
 such as he probably produced in considerable quantity, are
 seldom carefully preserved. or worth preserving, after the oc-
 casion which prompted them has passed away. We have not,
 for example, the ‘ lthyphallica,’ mentioned by Terentianus
 Maurus, nor the ‘Philtra,’ or verses on love-charms, alluded to
 by Pliny (Nat. Hist. xxviii. 2). On the other hand, certain
 pieces, like the ‘ Ciris’ and the ‘ Pervigilium Veneris,¹ are er-
 roneously ascribed to him.

 The fame of Catullus ﬂourished so long as Rome possessed
 a national literature, and his verses, particularl his hendeca-
 syllables, were imitated by the Italian poets ager the revival
 Of classical learning. Though much indebted to the Greeks,

 e possessed a vital originality of his own, which redeems his
 verses from the defects of servile copies. Greek in their forms
 of thought, and often in the turn of their diction, they are truly
 Roman in s irit. In grace, melody, and tenderness, he stands
 tastiest? ,ᾖῖἷίἒεὲοῗιῖἓΕἷὲἓῗῖιΐὲζᾎῗνὲἷξέἒῖἰέἷιῗξζ
 his pathos and point, were suited only to short poems. Nie-

 6 Lu: or cunnus.

 buhr’s opinion that Catullus was a gigantic and extraordinary
 genius, equal to the lyric poets of Greece previous to the age
 of Sophocles, is exaggerated (Lectures on Rom. Hist. ii. 1
 p. 153), and as wide of the truth as Quintilian’s depreciation \
 of him (Instit. Orat. x. l, §6). The Roman critic lived in an ‘
 age too late to relish the simplicity of the republican era.

 In the extracts which follow, I have endeavoured to select ³
 such passages from the poetry of Catullus as aﬂ'ord an insight
 into his tastes, pursuits, and habits of life, and I have pursued
 a similar plan with the selections from the verses of Tibullus,
 Propertius, and Ovid. The student will probably take the more
 interest in the verses, if they help him in some measure to a
 knowledge of their authors. For the like reason I have pre-
 ﬁxed to each collection of extracts a slight biographical sketch
 of the poet from whose writings they are taken.

 The numerals in brackets, e._q. iv (xxxi), refer to the number
 of the poems in the complete editions of Catullus. The text
 of Doering has been generally followed, with occasional cor-
 rections by Orelli.

 ALBII TIBULLI CARMINA.

 LIFE OF TIBULLUS.

 __._

 Or the personal history of Albius Tibullus (his prenomen
 is unknown) little has been preserved. He was of Latin ori-
 gin, of e uestrian rank, and born about 13.0. 54, thou h some
 of his edltors believe him to have been ﬁve years ol er, and
 place his birth in 3.0. 59. His paternal estate was at Pedum,
 between Tibur and Praeneste, and, like that of Virgil and Pro-
 pertius, it was conﬁscated, in part at least, during ,the civil
 wars ensuing on Caesar’s death. That he retained or recovered
 ῗυῗὲἶὲἒοῖἱῗιῗῖηῗ 3.1575: ’ἓὲῗῃξῖἑὲἳθεὲᾖὶῗὲ ξαὲἶίεξέῗὲ ζίἲὲῗῖ
 his favour with the great, hi sound health, and literary repu-
 tation.

 The conﬁscation of his land was probably owing to the ne-
 cessities of the government at the time, and not to any overt
 act of the poet himself. For Tibullus had a most un-Roman
 aversion from both politics and war. Of the latter he speaks
 always with abhorrence. In the former he seems to have taken
 Ὴοῖἒέἒξ Τέιῗιῖἰὲἓὲἒέἓῐῗὲζὲἒὶἶ ἶῗῗαῖἐ“ἔέέῃ“ἒὲἐέἒὲ”ὲῗῐίῗέἱῗ
 Augustus or Maecenas. His principal patron was M. Valerius
 Messala, who had fought againt the Triumvirs at Philippi, but
 who distinguished himself highly at Actium on the side of
 Augustus. Tibullus however refused to accompany Messala
 to this war, 3.0. 31. But in the autumn of the same year he
 followed his patron to Aquitania, as contubernalis, or aide-de-
 camp, and was present at the battle of Atax (Aude, in Langue-
 doe), which quelled the rebellion. In the autumn of n.0. 30,
 Messala was despatched to the East, and Tibullus set out in
 his train= but he fell sick on the voyage, and was left behind at
 Corcyra (l Eleg. i. 3). On his recovery he returned to Rome.
 The remainder of his days was spent in peaceful retirement
 and literary pursuits (Horace, l.c.). ’

 24 LIFE or· nummus.

 The mistress to whom Tibullus addresses the first six elegies
 of his ﬁrst book, is Delia, whose real name is said to have been
 Plancia, Plania, or Plautia (Apuleius, Apolog. p. 12: Bipont.
 ed.). Her condition is not very clearly made out, as some-
 times she appears to have been an Hetaera, like the Cynthia of
 Propertius, and at others a married woman. The second book
 of his poems is chieﬂy dedicated to a lady who goes by the
 poetic title of Nemesis. Ovid (Amor. iii. 9) mentions both
 Delia and Nemesis, and Horace (Carm. i. 33) alludes to a third
 name, of course a ﬁctitious one, Glycera.

 According to the Epigram of Domitius Marsus, Tibullus died
 about the same time as Virgil, i.e. B.c. 19.

 “ Te quoque Virgilii comitem non aaqua, Tibulle,
 Mon juvenem campos misit ad Elysios.”

 Ovid, a boy when Tibullus was a mature man, thus notices
 the diﬂ'erence of their respective age (Trist. iv. 5, 51) :

 “ Virgilium vidi tantum : nec avara Tibullo
 Tempus amicitia». fate. dedere men.”

 The ﬁrst two of the four books of elegies that go under his
 name are undoubtedly the work of Tibullus. Other and in-'
 ferior hands contributed to the third and fourth books, al-
 though he may have revised them and even added a few pas-

 ( ’ ”

 mood, if indeed it be a genuine product of his pen.

 On the merits of Tibullus the opinions of critics, both an-
 cient and modern, are much divided. Among the former, Quin-
 tilian (Instit. Orat. x. l, s 93) assigns to him the ﬁrst place

 _ among Roman elegiae poets; buthe adds, “Some prefer, Pro-

 Ρὲῗζῗὲω i332'231‘iafä‘13räßfnfä'äpl’meäuäidää’färefäﬁ

 tones of Mimnermus." Muretus, a better critic than either

 ἶ Arnold or Niebuhr, is more just in his opinion of Tibullus
 , (Schol. in Propertium): “Illum (i.e. Tibullum) judices sim-
 \plicius scripsisse quae cogitaret3 hunc (i.'e. Propertium) diligen-
 \tius cogitasse quae scriberet. In illo plus naturae, in hoc plus
 icuree atque industriae perspicias.” '

 LIFE OF PROPERTIUS.

 __...._..

 Sxx'rus Acamans Pnona'rms was a native of that part of
 Umbria which borders on Etruria, but the exact date and place
 of his birth are unknown. We know indeed that he was a few
 years older than Ovid, who was born in 3.0. 43. Propertius
 may therefore have been born in 3.0. 51 or 50. He did not
 belong to a family of distinction, yet his father owned consi-
 derable landed propert , which however was much impaired by
 an agrarian division—t at, perhaps, which took place after the
 war between Octavianus and Sextus Pompeius, in 8.0. 36. At
 that time Propertius had not assumed the dress of manhood,
 —toga virilia-ix. he was under sixteen years of age (comp.
 Eleg. 24, 37; iv. l, 129). In that year his father was dead;
 he is conjectured to have been among the victims who pe-
 rished in the famine or on the capture of Perusia. From the
 ﬁrst elegy of his Fourth Book, it appears that Propertius was
 destined for the law ; but, like Ovid, he abandoned it for lite-
 rature, although the loss of a portion of his patrimonial estate
 had narrowed his means of living,-—“ In tenues cogeris ipse
 Lares” (iv. l, 128). He did not, like so many of the Roman
 literati of that period (ay. Horace), complete his education
 at Athens; yet his writings prove him to have been deeply
 versed in Greek learnin , of which indeed he is apt to make a
 rather ostentatious disp ay. He was also well read in Roman
 archaeology, as his Fourth, or, as it is sometimes reckoned, the
 Fifth Book of Elegies, shows.

 Propertius began to write verses at an early age; they at-
 tracted the notice of Maecenas (Eleg. ii. l, l7), and he was
 desired by his patron to celebrate the military achievements
 of Octavianus. He had however been previously noticed by
 L. Volcatius Tullus, one of the consuls in 3.0. 33. Cynthia
 was the principal mistress of Propertius, and the chief object

 of his verse. Her real name was Hostia (Apuleius, Apolog.
 p. l2: Bipont. ed.), and she was a native of Tibur (Tivoli).
 As Propertius alludes to Cynthia’s.“ doctus avus,” she may
 have been a grand-daughter of that Hostius who wrote a
 poem on the Histric War, i.e. the war between Rome and Il-
 lyricum, n.c. 178 (see Li , xli.; Propert. Eleg. 18). She

 2 was a highly accomplishe woman, who wrote verses and was ‘

 5 well skilled in music, dancing, needlework—“caste Palladis ’

 artes,”—and other female accomplishments. A Roman matron
 was eldom so gifted as Cynthia; the probability is therefore
 “ that she belonged to the numerous class of Hetaarze, a suppo-
 sition strengthened by the facts that she had had at least one
 lover before Propertius (Eleg. iii. 20), and that she forsook
 him for a time, and took up with a stupid Praetor who had
 come back from Illyricum with a well-lined purse. The youn er
 Pliny (Epist. vi. l5; ix. 22) mentions one Passienus Pa us

 as lineally descended from Propertius. He may accordingly, w
 after Cynthia’s death, have formed a legitimate connection. ξ

 The date of his own decease is uncertain. Ovid mentions him
 twice in his ‘Ars Amatoria’ 333, 536); but from these
 passages the only sound inference is, that Propertius had then
 (about 3.0. 15) ceased to write; it does not follow that he had
 ceased to live.

 Propertius had a house on the Esquiline Hill at Rome, near
 the gardens of Maecenas. He was on good terms with con-
 temporary poet and men of letters, 42.9. with Ovid, Ponticus,

 Bassus, and Virgil, who seems to have read portions of his x

 epic poem to him as to a friend (Eleg. 34, 63). Tibullus
 he does not mention, nor Horace, though, with Propertius, he
 belonged to the inner circle of Miecenas’s proteges. It was the
 ambition of Propertius to be accounted the Callimachus or the
 Philetas of Rome (Eleg. iv. 1, 63), and hence perhaps the eru-
 dite character, and occasional difﬁculty in his writings. The
 Alexandrian model clothed in verse the lore which he collected
 in the library of the Ptolemies, and the Roman imitator deals

 largely also in curious mytholog-and archaeological allusions. K
 In Propertius much to reward

 The advanced scholar will ﬁn
 his studies. In his Elegies indeed he displays less wit, fancy,
 and richness of language than Ovid, less tenderness than Ti-
 bullus, and less original vigour than Catullus. Yet these se-
 veral degrees of inferiority are counterbalanced by his nervous
 style, the occasional beauty of his images, and the skill with
 which he renders his learning subservient to poetry. At all

 mm: or mormanus. 47

 events, in the Elegies of Propertius we have reserved an ex-
 cellent s’ample of an order of poets, who, ike Calvus and
 others, illustrate the learned character of the Augustan age.
 The diﬁculty of his vere is probably in some, if not in great,
 measure attributable to the corruption of his text in the few
 manuscripts of it which exist. In the following extract, the
 readings of Mr. Paley, the latest and one of the best editors
 of the poet, have been followed, and in selecting them I have
 ﬁrm-ally taken such passages as refer to the early history of
 me.

 LIFE OF OVID.

 P. Ovmms Naso was born on the 20th of March, at Sulmo,
 a. town of the Peligni (Sulmone in the Abruezi). The year of
 his birth, 3.0. 43, was that in which the Consuls Hirtius
 and Pansa were slain in battle before Mutina (Modena), the
 second Triumvirate was formed, and the last hopes of the
 senatorian party were extinguished. His family was of e ues-
 trian rank: both his parents attained to great age, an he
 had an elder brother, who, born on the same day of the
 month with the poet, died in his 21st year. (Tristia, iv. El.
 10; Fasti, iv. 685 ; Amor, ii. El. i. 15.)

 Ovid received the usual rhetorical training of well-born
 Roman youth: his instructors were Arellius Fuscus and
 Porcius Latro. Seneca, the rhetorician, heard Ovid declaim,
 and describes his style as poetry in prose. He was choice in
 the use of words, and fond of analysing the emotions of man-
 kind; but argument was irksome to him, and accordingly he
 preferred moral to legal discussions. The result of his rheto-
 rical lectures is apparent in his verses: Ovid is as much a
 pleader in heroic or elegiae measure as Euripides was in
 iambic. (Seneca, Controv. 2, 10d 16, 23.)

 Like many persons destined by nature to become poets,
 Ovid was intended by his father for the law. He was not
 disobedient to the paternal wishes : he tried hard to master
 the formularies of the law and the science of the jurists. But
 his toil was in vain': his poetical bent was not to be con-
 trolled: law cases and arguments in his hand ran into metre,
 and perhaps Ovid’s early success as a poet reconciled his
 father to his disappointment.

 Luckily he had not his bread to earn; whether heinherited

 his native Sulmo, a house on the Capitoline Hill at Rome
 (Tristia i. El. 3), and a suburban garden of remarkable
 beauty. At one period of his life he had leisure and means
 to travel, and visited, in company with his friend, Emilius
 Macer, Sicily and the Lesser Asia (Epist. ex Ponto, ii. 10).
 He was thrice married; the third time happily. His last
 wife was a member of the Fabian family. She bore Ovid a
 daughter, who was named Perilla, and inherited her father’s
 literary talents.

 Ovid’s life, until his ﬁftieth year, passed apparently in un-
 broken prosperity. He was the most popular writer of the
 day; was admitted into the highest circles of Rome; and, cor-
 rectly as it proved, looked forward to fame as enduring as that
 which he himself predicted for Lucretius. But when his hair
 was tinged with grey, misfortune fell upon him at once and
 for ever. For some offence, whether personal or political it is
 now useless to inquire, Augustus banished him to Tomi (To-
 moevar), A.D. 8, on the shores of the Euxine Sea. There, in
 spite of incessant solicitations for recall, or at least permission
 m end his days in a less inhospitable region, he died, after
 seven or eight years of various wretchedness, shortly after the
 death of Augustus, i.e. 15 or 16 A.D.

 The works of Ovid may be most properly divided into those
 which he wrote before, and those which he wrote after, his
 banishment. In the one he displays the conﬁdence, and some-
 times the carelessness, of a public favourite; in the other the
 despair and irritation incident to a fall from high estate. To
 the former class belong his Epistolae Heroidum, or Imaginary
 Letters to and from women of the heroic age of Greece. His
 Amores, or books of elegies on topics, generally, of an erotic
 character; his Ars Amatoria and Remedium Amoria; and his
 learned poems, the Metamor hoece, a Histo of remarkable
 Transformations; and the asti, or metrica History of the
 Roman Calendar. The two last-mentioned works stand apart
 from Ovid’s other writings, and will be brieﬂy characterized
 when we come to the extracts from them respectively. To the

 latter class belong his ﬁve books of Tristia, and his four of .

 Epistolce ea· Ponto, in which are contained the record of his
 sorrows, of his ineffectual appeals to Augustus and the leading
 men of the Augustan court, of his diminishing hopes and his
 declining years. Besides these we have a few detached poems,
 such as the elegy entitled Nux, in which a walnut-tree be-
 wails its hard fate and ill-usage ; and Ibie, a long and bitter

 mm or own. 73

 satire against some person now unknown. Lastly, he was the
 author of a tragedy called Medea, in which, in-Quintilian’s
 opinion (Instit. Orat. x. 98; Seneca, Controv. 10; Tacitus.
 Cans. Corrupt. Eloquent. l2), Ovid showed himself capable of
 dealing with pzissions of the higher mood. Of this drama
 only two lines have been reserved, but we may judge of the
 conception of his heroine hy the grand soliloquy which he has
 put into her mouth in the eleventh book of the Metamor-
 phoses (vv. 11—71). The poems which. Ovid composed in the

 treasure to the philologer, since they would exhibit a very
 early form of the Teutonic dialects of Europe. Other produc-
 tions of his fertile pen have also perished; but a poem on
 Cosmetics (Medicamina Faciei), another on Fishing (Ha-
 lieutica), and an address of condolence to Livia Augusta on
 gae-geoth of her son Drusus Nero, are incorrectly assigned to
 v1 . -

 In the writings of his earlier and happier years, Ovid dis-
 plays all the ualities of a popular author. His fancy is
 always alert; is eloquence 1s unfailing; he often oﬁ'ends
 ῗιὶἲῗέ ἓξὲξ 213⁰v2³3²1¹1⁸in⁸30⁸333b23t3eb33293431333703322,iii
 luxuriance of his fanc , he would have probably ranked even
 with Lucretius and irgil in the more elevated walks of his
 art. As it is, he is the ﬁrst of ancient elegiae poets, so far
 at least as we have the means of comparison. Nothing in
 Mimnermus or Simonides, nothing in Tibullus or Propertius
 .possesses the variety, the eloquence, the imaginative opulence,
 or even at times the pathos of Ovid. In pathetic touches,
 indeed, Catullus alone equals or surpasses him.

 The oems which Ovid composed in exile are generally, and

 ‘ not unjustl , considered tedious. The nine books of the

 Tristia an the Epistola eac Ponto are certainly one unvaried
 wail for happiness lost, and for hopes deferred or extinguished.
 Yet perhaps this censure is too indiscriminate. In their col-
 lected form they are read under great disadvantage. Originally
 they were addressed to different persons, and therefore repe-
 tition of the same sorrow was allowable; whereas we hear the
 cplmplaaint and :11 the echogs of itil ’tl-*he sarpeLftpilt mayl‘ﬁe

 and performances. But the actual receivers of these letters
 were not sensible of this defect in them: only when several
 letters on the same topics are grouped together, does it
 become apparent. Then as regards the unmanliness imputed
 to Ovid, on account of his incessant complaints of the climate,
 the people, and the loneliness of Tomi. “ It is so unphilo—
 sophic.” In the ﬁrst place, the poet did not pretend to be a
 Stoic; and for the matter of exile, he was at least as philo-
 ophic a either Cicero or Seneca. In the next, life in Rome
 was to him the only endurable mode of existence. He would
 doubtless have been better pleased, had Augustus permitted
 him to reside at Marseilles or Athens. among reﬁned com-

 of the Roman empire. Yet even· in Greece or Romanized
 Gaul he would have yearned for the baths, the theatres, the
 libraries and the saloons of the capital, for the brilliant court of
 which he had so long been the laureate, for the wits and poets
 who had accompanied him to the levées and suppers of Julia.
 In such circles Ovid throve like a tender plant; and, like a.
 tender plant, he pined away beneath the frosty winds of the
 Euxine.

 disgrace and exile took place. In his despair at the moment, Ovid threw
 the manuscript, which he then believed to be the only one, into the ﬁre;
 but, fortunately, a few copies were safe in the hands of friends, and in
 calmer hours he repented of his haste, and rejoiced in the preservation of
 his imperfect work. It might, he thought. remind readers at Rome of the
 unhappy exile at Tomi. Among the most beautiful portions of this noble
 and learned, though unequal poem, may be enumerated the description of
 the Golden Age (Metamorph. i. 89-112); of the Palace of the Sun
 (ii. 1-18); of Narcissus at the Fountain (iii. 407-510); the story of
 Pyramus and Thisbe (iv. 55—166); Medea's Soliloquy (vii. 11—71); the
 Death of Procris (vii. 661-862); the stories of Daedalus and learns (viii.
 152-259); of Baucis and Philemon (viii. sle-m), the Cave of Sleep
 (xi. 592—632); and the contention of Ajax and Ulysses for the amour of
 Achilles (xiii. l-390)——perhaps the ﬁnest specimen of poetic eloquence in
 ancient literature. Some of these subjects were treated by Ovid in Elegiae
 verse also——e.g. the story of Daedalus and Icarus (Ars Amat. ii. 21—96);
 the death of Procris (Ars Amat. iii. 686—746). Medea's emotions are
 again described in an epistle to Jason (Heroid. xii); and in the tale of
 Hyreus (Fasti, v. 499—586), the poet repeats some of the incidents of the
 story of Baucis and Philemon.

 The extracts which follow are the description of the Golden Age; of
 Narcissus at the Fountain; of the Cave of Sleep; the story of Baucis and
 Philemon; Medea's Soliloquy; and the Speeches of Ajax and Ulysses.

 E LIBRIS P. OVIDII NASONIS QUI INSCRIBUNTUR FASTI.

 DE JANI BICIPITIS ORIGINE ET CULTU.
 [P. Ovidii Nasoni· Fastorum i. 89-284.]

 Quem tamen esse deum te dicam, Jane biformia?
 Nam tibi par nullum Graecia numen habet.
 Ede simul causam, our de coelestibus unus,
 Sitque quod a tergo, aitque quod ante, vides.
 Haec ego eum sumptis agitarem mente tabellis, 5
 Lucidior visa est, quam fuit ante, domus.
 Tum sacer, ancipiti mirandus imagine, Janus
 Bina repens oculis obtulit ora meis.
 Obstupui, sensique metu riguisse capillos,
 Et gelidum subito fri ore pectus erat. lO
 Ille⁷ tenens dextra baouzum clavemque sinistra,
 Edidit hos nobis ore priore sonos :

 CARRINA.

 “ Disce, metu posito, vates operose dierum,
 Quod petis, et voces percipe mente meas.
 Me Chaos antiqui,——nam res sum prisca-vocabantz
 Adspice, quam longi temporis acta canam.
 Lucidus hic aer et, quae tria corpora restant,
 Ignis, aqua, tellus-unus acervus erant.
 Ut semel haec rerum secessit lite suarum,
 Inque novas abiit massa soluta domos,
 Altum ﬁamma etit : propior locus aera cepitr
 Sederunt me io terra fretumque solo.
 Tunc ego, qui fueram globus et sine imagine moles,
 In faciem redii dignaque membra deo.
 Nunc quoque, confusa quondam nota parva ﬁgure,
 Ante quod est in me, postque, videtur idem.
 Accipe, quaesita quae causa sit altera forms,
 Hanc simul ut noris omciumque meum.
 Quicquid ubique vides, caelum, mare. nubila, terras,
 Omnia sunt nostra clausa, patentque manu.
 Me penes est unum vasti custodia mundi,
 Et ’us vertendi cardinis omne meum est.
 Cum libuit pacem placidis emittere tectis
 Libera er etuas ambulat illa vias.
 Sanguine et⁸ ero totus miscebitur orbis,
 Ni teneant rigidus condita bella serae.
 Praesideo foribus caeli cum mitibus Horis :
 It, redit oiﬁcio Jupiter ipse meo.
 Inde vocor Janus: qui cum cereale sacerdos
 Imponit libum farraque mixta sale,
 Nomina ridebis= modo namque Patulcius idem
 Et modo sacrifico Clusius ore vocor.
 Scilicet alterno voluit rudis illa vetustas
 Nomine diversas significare vices.
 Vis mea narrata est : causam nunc disce ﬁgure;
 Jam tamen hanc aliqua tu quoque parte vides.
 Omnis habet geminas, hinc atque hinc, janua frontes,
 , E quibus haec populum spectat, at illa Larem.
 U ue sedens vester primi prope limina tecti
 unitor egressus introitusque videt=
 Sic ego prospicio, ccelestis janitor aulae,
 ans partes Hesperiasque simul.
 Ora vides Hecates in tres vergentia partes,
 Servet ut in ternas compita secta vias;

 Cernere, non moto corpore, bina licet.”
 Dixerat, et vultu, si plura requirere vellem,
 Se mihi difficilem non fore, fassus erat.
 Sumpsi animum, gratesque deo non territus egi,
 Verbaque sum spectans pauca locutus humum :
 “ Dic, age, frigoribus quare novus incipit annus,
 Qui melius per ver incipiendus erat.
 Omnia tunc fierent, tunc est nova temporis aetas,
 Et nova de gravido palmite gemma tumet,
 Et modo formatis operitur frondibus arbos,
 Prodit et in summum seminis herba solum,
 Et tepidum volucres concentibus aera mulcent,
 Ludit et in pratis luxuriatque ecus.
 Tum blandi soles, ignotaque pro ’t hinmdo,
 Et luteum celsa sub trabe fingit opus ;
 Tum patitur cultus ager, et renovatur aratro3
 Haec anni novitas jure vocanda fujt.”
 Quaesieram multis : non multis ille moratus
 Contulit in versus sic sua verba duos :
 “Bruma novi prima est veterisque novissima solis;
 Principium capiunt Phoebus et annus idem.”
 Post ea mirabar, cur non sine litibus esset
 Prima dies. “ Causam percipe,” Janus ait.
 " Tempora commisi nascentia rebus agendis,
 Totus ab auspicio ne foret annus iners.
 Quisque suas artes ob idem delibat agendo,
 Nec plus quam solitum testificatur opus.”

 Mox ego: “ Cur, quamvis aliorum numina placem,

 Jane, tibi primum tura merumque fero ’f”
 “ Ut per me possis aditum, qui limina servo.

 Ad quoscumque voles,” inquit, “ habere deos.”
 “ At cur laeta tuis dicuntur verba Kalendis,

 Et damus alternas accipimusque preces 'f”

 _ Tum deus incumbens baculo, quem dextra gerebat,

 “ Omina principiis,” inquit, “ inesse solent.
 Ad primam vocem timidas advertitis aures,
 Et visam primum consulit augur avem.
 Templa patent auresque deum, nec lingua caducas
 Concipit ulla preces, dictaque ondus habent.”
 Desierat Janus; nec longa silentia feci,
 Sed tetigi verbis ultima verba meis=

 “ Et data sub niveo candida mella cado f”
 “ Omen,” ait, “ causa est, ut res sapor ille sequatur,
 Et peragat cceptum dulcis ut annus iter.” 100
 “ Dulcia cur dentur video; stipis adjice causam,

 Risit, et, “ Ο quam te fallunt tua secula,” dixit,

 Nec pudor in stipula placidam cepisse quietem,

 Et levis argenti lamina crimen erat. 120
 At postquam Fortuna loci caput extulit hujus, ·
 Et tetigit summos vertice Roma deos;
 Creverunt et opes, et opum furiosa cupido.
 Et, quum possideant plurima, plura volunt.

 Atque ipsae vitiis sunt alimenta vices.
 In pretio pretium nunc est; dat census honores,
 Census amicitias = pauper ubique jacet.
 Tu tamen, auspicium cur sit stipis utile, quaeris,
 Curque juvent nostras sera vetusta manus, 130

 Victaque concedit prisca moneta novae.

 NOTES ΟΝ CATULLUS.

 -φ-

 I. Owing to the grace and pathos of this and the following poem on V
 Lesbia’s sparrow, the ‘Paaser Catulli‘ became almost proverbial for ele-
 gance .and tender sentiment among later Roman writers. (See Martial,
 Epigramm. i. 8. 110; iv. 14; xi. 7.) In the name Lesbis there may be
 an allusion to Hostia’s accomplishments in literature or music, i. e. to Ssp- ἲ
 pho of Lesbos.

 3. Primum Aliquam-The tip of the fore-{ingen—Deu'derlo meo ni-
 tenti. ⁶ To the bright and beautiful object of my love.’ Desidet-ium here
 signiﬁes the object of love, as πόθος does in Bion’s Idyll. i. 283. Nitere, m*-
 tor, nitidus. are words commonly expressive of female beauty ; e. y. Horace,
 0d. i. 19. 5, ‘Urit me Glycerin nitor ,·¹ id. ib. ii. 12. 19, ‘ Nitidce virgines ς·
 id. ib. i. 6. l3, ‘ Miseri quibus intentata nites.’ ‘

 5—13. Quum.. .ligatam.——The order of the words in this passage is:
 ‘ Quum lubet desiderio meo nitenti,’ i. e. meae formosm puellm, *jocari
 nescio-quid carum,’ i. e. dulce aliquid, ⁴ ad solatiolum sui doloris: credo,
 ut quo gravis ardor acquiescit =’ (si) ‘ possem, sicut ipsa, tecum ludere, et
 tristes animi levare curas,’ id. scil. lusus ille ⁴ foret tam gratum mihi uam
 ferunt’ (dicunt) ‘aureolum malum fuisse pernici puellae, quod’ (ma um).
 ‘ solvit zonam diu ligatam.’

 ll. Paella: pernici-Atalanta was daughter of Schoénus, king of On-
 chestus in Bceotia, the most swift~footed of women, who lost her race with
 Hippomenes through steeping to pick up the golden apples that her suitor
 and competitor‘ﬂung on the race-course. Shakspeare, ‘ As You Like It,’
 act sc. 2, speaks of ‘ Atalanta’s better part,’ ἰ. e. her swiftness of foot.

 13. me.—The zona or cinqulum was the girdle worn about the
 loins by both sexes; its chief use was to hold up the tunic when the
 wearer was working, walking. etc. In Greek ζώνη or ξωστῆρ is properly
 the man’s girdle, ζώνιον the woman’s. Young women, however, even when
 their tunice were not girt up, retained the girdle, which, being removed
 on the marriage-day, was an emblem of their condition, and was there-
 fore called ζώνη παρθενικὴ, ‘ the maiden’s belt.’-—Diu Is‘gatam. ‘ Long un-
 clasped,’ because Atalanta had vanquished many suitors before she was
 herself conquered by Hippomenes. and so had long remained unmarried.
 The s7tory of Hippomenes and Atalanta is told by Ovid, Metamorph. x.

 titled, ‘Pss'ltacus Melior-inl (3) Lotichius. a celebrated writer of Latin,
 who ﬂourished in Germany about the middle of the seventeenth century,

 ⁸ Nunc, raptus rapido maloque fato,
 Ad manea abiit tenebrieosos.’

 In grace aud felicity of expression, however, the original far surpasses the
 copies; and, indeed, if Catullus has any rivals in this poem, they must be
 sought in French rather than in Latin literature.

 2. Quantum est homirnam »multorum (i. e. quotquot sunt homines
 elegantes et delicati), all persons endowed with reﬁned feelings—send,
 bility. Venustus, derived from Venus, the goddess of grace and beauty,-
 has a moral as well as a physical import, and may he applied to mental as
 well as corporal qualities, and to things and places as well an persons.
 Catullus terms his friend Fabullus ⁶ venuste noster' (xiii. 6), and Cicero
 (De Orut. ii. 56) says to Julius Caesar, ‘ Quum omnium sis venundat-’mus
 et urbanissimus,’ ‘aman perfectly pleasant and polite.‘ The beautiful
 peninsula of Sirmio is described by Catullus (xxxi. 92) as ‘ venusta,’ and
 Cicero calls ready wit (facilitas jocandi), ¹ sermo venustus et urbanus ; ' on
 the other hand, Catullus designates a piece of ill-timed pleasantry, as
 ‘ res sordida et inoénsuta.’

 7. Ipsam (i. e. dominam, ‘suam ipsam ’), ‘ his own mistress.’ Compare
 Plantus (Casia. act iv. sc. 2, v. 10), ‘ Ego eo quo me ipsa (domina) vocat.’
 αὕη-ος and αὕτη, in like manner, stand for dominus, domina.

 ll. Tmebﬁcosum.—Compare Sallust (Catil. c. 52), ‘ Inferorum loco
 sunt tetra, inculta, freda, atque formidolosa ;’ Hesiod (Theogon. 744),
 Νυκτὸς ἐρεμνῆς . . . οἰκία δεινάς and Virgil (Eneid. vii. 268). Anm and the
 Sibyl at the entrance of the nether-realm (primis in faucibus Orei)=

 ¹ The undiscovered country, from whose bourne
 No traveller returns.‘

 And compare an epigram by Antipater (Analect. Vet. Poet. Gmcor. 90,
 tome ii. 37, ed. Brunch:

 ἐς ’γὰρ ἄκαμπτον
 'Es τὸν dudm-mov χῶρον ἔβης luipolt.-

 to Bion's Idyll (the Lament of Aphrodite on the Death of Adonis),

 Compare also Ovid (Amores, ii. 6. 39):
 ‘ Optima prima fere manibus rapiuntur avaris.’

 17. Ofactum male l—‘ Woe worth the hour l' So Cicero, on the news
 of Alexion’s death, writes (Ad Attic. xv. l). ‘ O factum male de Alexione.’

 18. Tua muse opera.-⁸ On your account ’ - tua causa, propter te.

 19. Wach“ rubent ocelli-Ure swollen and red ; ’ as Tibullus (Eleg. i.
 s, 68) g ‘ Et tua jam tletu lamina fessa tnment.‘

 111. This is the consecration to Castor and Pollux (see Acts of the
 Apostles, xxviii. 11) of the vessel which brought Catullus safe from
 Bithynis to Italy. He appears, from verses 6-10, to have purchased his
 yacht in Bithynia, to have embarked there, to have coasted Thrace, sailed
 through the Archipelago, then up the Adriatic, and passing into one of the
 numerious branches of the P0, to have landed on the peninsula of Sirmio

 xxxi. .
 ( 1. Phaselus, in its ﬁrst sense, means a kind of bean, a kidney-bean
 (Virgil, Georg. i. 227): ⁴ viciamque seres vilemque phaselum] Thence it
 comes to signify a light-sailing galley or pinnace, shaped like a bean, ί. e.
 narrow in the beam, and built of the slightest materials; e. g. the phaseli
 which the Egyptians used on the Nile were made of papyrus-leaves
 stretched over a frame of slight woodwork, and sometimes even of clay
 baked and painted: ‘ Parvula fictilibus solitum dare vela phaselis’ (Juve-
 nal. Satir. xv. 127). Horace (0d. iii. 2. 29) applies the epithet offraqilis
 to this kind of sailing-vessel. The test of sailing unharmed from the
 Euxine to Italy was the greater in so frail a vessel; nor does Catullus

 2. Ait fume navium «lenimina-This is a well-known Greek con-
 struction -= ᾔσθετ’ ἐμπεσών. See Key’s Latin Grammar (1060) for exam-
 ples, and compare Virgil (AEneid, ii. 377), ‘ Sensit medios delapsus in
 hostes;’ and, Horace (Epist. i. 7. 22), ⁴ Vir bonus ct sapiens dignis ait
 esse paratus.

 3. Praua-The part for the whole, the board for the ship, by the gram-
 matical ﬁgure synecdoche. (Quintil. Inst. viii., 6, ς 19.) So Virgil,
 Eneid, iii. 191 : ⁸ Cum trahe,‘ pro ‘ nave.’

 4. Neque . . . nequisse = potuisse-Pulmonis the blade of the oar. 0b-
 aerve that the diﬂ’erent modes of motion are in one passage ascribed to the
 ship, viz. nare, in ⁴ natantis,’ preterire =- παρατρέχειν, and volare.

 6-7. Hoc mat more a ‘ hoe aﬁrmare ait.’—Mina.s', i. e. procellis.

 quent and sudden storms to which it was liable. The bad character of the

 7. Cyclades.—-—'l‘he Cyclades are a group of islands so called because
 they lie in a circle (ἐν κύκλῳ) around Delos, the smallest, but from
 being one of the great centres of Hellenic worship, the most important
 of them. They are generally reckoned twelve in number. though some
 geographers, as Artemidorus, made them ﬁfteen, and some, as Scylax (p.
 22), divide them into two groupes, a northern and a southern (Strabo, x.

 118 nous on

 485). According to Thucydides (ij 4) they were originally peopled by
 Car-inns, who, for their piracies, were expelled by Minos, king of Crete
 (Herod. i. 71). Afterwards they were colonized by Ionisns and Dorisns.

 8. Rhodum nobilem-Rhodes, one of the largest islands of the Egean,
 or, more properly, of the Carpathian Sea, is seldom mentioned by the
 poets, Latin or Greek, without some epithet expressive of its size, power,
 and wealth, e. g. Horace (Carm. i. 7) calls it ‘ clara,’ because it was emi-
 nent for the brave and independent spirit of its people, before Rome an-
 nexed it to her empire, and for its commerce, arts, and philosophical
 schools long afterwards. Its brazen statue of the sun, commonly called
 the Colossus of Rhodes, the work of Chares of Lindus, was one of the
 seven wonders of the ancient world. Strabo (xiv. p. 654) says that the
 capital of the island, also called Rhodiis, surpassed all other cities in the
 spaciousness and convenience of its ports, streets, walls, and public ediﬁces.
 In the middle ages of Europe it was no less famous for its college of the
 Knights Hospitalcrs of St. John, and for its long resistance to the Ottoman
 power.-—Horridam Thraciam. ¹ Rough, uncultivated ;’ just as Germania
 is termed ‘horrida’ by Horace (Carm. iv. 5. 26).-Propontida. The
 Propontis (Sea of Marmora) is the sea between Thrace and Asia Minor :
 the ancient name implies the sea before the entrance of the Pontus or
 Euxine. Its proportions are stated by Herodotus (iv. 85) with tolerable
 am.caress:*.22.::m.:z:.2nssz n'a-3222352212:
 island of Marmora, the ancient Preconnesus, near the western entrance
 of the sea. N

 9. Ponticum sinum. -The Euxine, now the Black Sea. Catullus
 fastens on it the epithet trucem, because this sea was in ill repute for
 storms, and the barbarous character of the inhabitants of its shores be-
 fore they were covered with Greek colonies. Its original appellation was
 (A'lfenus (11441;;- Ἀξενος, Scymn. p. 734; Strabo, vii. 298). Ovid says

 ‘ Frigida me cohibent Euxini littora Ponti;
 Dictus ab antiquis Axenus ille fuit.’

 10. Ubi-In Pontus, a region remarkable for the excellence and variety
 of its timber. Compare Horace (Carm. i. 14. ll):
 ‘Quamvis Pontica pinus
 Silvae lilia nobilis.’

 ll. Comata diva—Milton (Par. Lost, vii.) has a similar metaphor:
 ‘ Bush with frizzled hair complete.’— Cytorio in jugo. Cytorus, or Cytorum.
 was a town on the coast of the Euxine, situated between Amastris and
 Cape Carambis. The name is found in Iliad, ii. 853. The mountains at
 the back of Cytorns were covered with box-trees, Virgil (Georg. 437):
 ⁸ Et juvat undantem buxo spectare Cytorum ;’ and Apollonius of Rhodes
 (Argonaut. ii. 944) terms it ' wooded Cytorus.’

 12. Loquente sibilum edidit comm—Compare Petronius (Cm-m. 120) z

 ⁸ Mollia discordi strepitu virgulta loquuntur.g

 13. Amastri Ponticae-Amutris was a city of Paphlagonia. It is de-
 scribed by the younger Pliny, in a letter to Trajan (Epist. x. 99), as I
 handsome city, with a very long open space (platea), on one side of which

 ran a pestilential open drain. Pliny obtained permission from the Em-
 peror to roof over this sewer.

 l5. Ultima ea· origins.—‘ The parent tree.’ Compare Ans]. Vet. Poet.
 Gratcorum (tom. iii. Epigr. 385, p. 232, ed. Brunck):

 22. Neque ulla noim-To this day the Greek sailors, on the ﬁrst appear-
 ance of a gale in the Arches, as the Archipelago is termed, ﬂy for protec-
 tion to the picture of the saint who is the special guardian of their vessel.
 The words in the text imply that the Phaselns had been favoured through-
 out its voyage with favourable winds and tides. The Dii litterale» are the
 particular deities of the sea and coast. Compare Virgil (Georg. i. 436):

 ‘ Votaque servati solvent in littore nautaa
 Glauco, et Panopete, et Inoö Melicertie.’

 the 'Catalects Virgilii,’ being a satire on Ventidius, the general of M._'

 on which was situated his patrimonial country-house. The promontory
 was about ten miles in circumference, and projected into the Lacus Bena-
 cus, nowLago di Gerda. ⁶ Sirmione,’ says Eustace (‘ Classical Tour,’ vol. i.
 c. 5. 8vo edition , ‘appears as an island, so low and so narrow is the
 bank that unites it to the mainland. The. promontory spreads behind the
 town, and rises into a hill entirely covered with olives. Catullus could
 not have chosen a more delightful spot. In the centre of a magniﬁcent
 lake, surrounded with scenery of the greatest variety and majesty, secluded
 from the world. yet beholding from his garden the villas of his Veronese
 friends, he might enjoy equally the pleasures of retirement and society.
 More convenience and more beauty are seldom united. The soil is fertile;
 the-surface is varied; sometimes shelving in gentle declivities, at other
 times breaking into craggy magniﬁcence, and thus furnishing every re-
 quisite for delightml walks and luxurious baths; while the views vary at
 every turn, presenting rich coasts or barren mountains, sometimes conﬁned
 to the cultivated scenes of the neighbouring shore. and at other times be-
 wildered and lost in the windings of the lake or the recesses of the Alps.‘

 '2. 0celle.—-That which gives light and expression to the scene. Cicero
 (Ad Attic. xvi. 6) says, ‘ Cur, ocellos Italiat, villulas mess, non video.”
 The rose is called ἀνθῶν ὀφθαλμὸς, the eye of ﬂowers, by Achilles Tatius.
 Compare Milton (Par. Lost, iv. 240): ‘Athens, the eye of Greece.'—Lc'-
 qus-utiba. ⁴ lucid.'—Stagm'a marique vasto. Neptune is the deity of waters
 generally, both salt und fresh. Compare Milton (Cpmus, 18):

 ‘ Neptune, besides the sway
 Of every salt ﬂood, and each ebbing stream.

 The Greek Poseidon also was ἐπιθαλάσσιαι καὶ erratum”. See Aristo.
 phanes, Plutus, vv. 396, 397.

 4. Quam te libentem-Compare the joy expressed by Ulysses at his
 return to Ithaca after twenty years of absence (Odyss. xiii. 354):

 Xui‘p’ Ἰθάκη· μετ’ ἄεθλα, μετ’ ἄλγεα, πικρὰ θαλάσσης
 Ἀσπασίας τεὸν οὖδας ἱκάνομαι·

 und the similar emotionassigned by Shakspeare to Richard II. (act
 se* 2>⁶ ⁴ I weep for joy
 To stand upon my kingdom once again.’

 5. Thyniam-Thynia was a small island in the Euxine Sea, dia-
 tent about one mile from the coast of Bithynia. Its modern name is
 Kippe}. It contained a port and naval station belonging to Heracleia
 (An-ian. Peripl. Pont. Eux. p. 13).—Bithynas campo». Bithynia was
 a portion of Asia Minor which occupied the eastern part of the coast
 of the Propontis, the east coast of the Thracian Bosporus, and a con-
 siderable portion of the coast of the Euxine. The Bithyni were a
 Thracian tribe who emigrated into Asia from the banks of the Stry-
 mon (Herodot. vii. 75). At ﬁrst they were divided into two tribes,
 Thyni and Bithyni; but in course of time the former of these names
 fell into disuse. When ﬁrst mentioned in history they were subject
 to Caesus, king of Lydia: after the destruction of the Lydian kingdom
 by Cyrus and the Persians, 3.0. 546. they formed a satrspy of Persia,
 or at least part of one. Next sprang up a race of native kings, iu-

 queathing his kingdom to the Romans in 3.0. 74. It was then reduced
 into the form of u province, and after the death of Mithridates in n.c. 63.
 the western part of his kingdom of Pontus was annexed to it, and Cn. Pom-
 peius divided it into eleven .communes, or municipalities (Dion Cassius,
 xxx. 8. 10—12: Strabo, p. 541). Hence it was sometimes styled in public
 acts and inscriptions ‘ Bithynia and Pontus,’ e. y. ‘ Procos provinciae Ponti
 et Bithynise3⁹ yet it was often called simply Bithynia (Tao. Annal. i. 74).
 Pliny the younger was Proconsul of Bithynia, ΑΛ). 103—6, and from this
 province wrote to Trajan his remarkable letter about the early Christians
 (Plin. x. Epistol. 97).

 7. Solutis curis. -Anxieties of which the pressure (ligamen) is
 loosened; properly, the mind is said to be released from cares; but Livy
 (iii. 8) combines ‘solvere curam,’ like Catullus: ‘Eo solutiore ours in
 Lucretium incidunt consulem.’—Peregrina labore. *After wandering la-
 bours long.’—Larem ad nostrum. ‘The home of my fathers,’ where the
 family deities (Lares familiares) had their shrines.

 ll. Pro laboribus tantine-Not merely ‘the toil of travel ’ (labor pere-
 grinus), but the disappointments and mortifications which Catullus had
 met with in his bootless journey to Bithynia. He alludes to these cir-
 cumstance:i in his poems (x. and xvii), e. y. ⁴ Provincia quod mala inci-
 disset. an -

 ‘ Ut mihi, qui menm secutus
 Praetorem, refero datum lucello.’

 12. Lydiae lawn—The poet calls the Benacus ‘the Lydian waters,’ in
 allusion to the supposed origin of the Tyrrhenians of Etruria, who once
 possessed and emigrated from Lydia. The Rbaeti, who founded Verona,
 and dwelt on the shores of the Lake Benacus, were a Tyrrhenian race
 [Ῥω-οὶ, *ru ῥηικδν ἔθνος. Stephanus, Byzant. s. α] For an elucidation
 of the long ebated origin of the Etruscans, see Donaldson’s ‘Varronianus’
 (ss ll, 16, 2nd edition).

 V. l. Eyelidosf-Compare Columell. x. 282: ‘ Nunc rer egelidum, nunc
 est mollissimus annus.’ ‘Egelidos,’ deprived of cold: e =- a privative.
 In the Augustan writers it is the opposite of ‘gelidus;' e. g. Ovid
 (Amor. ii. ll. 10)= ⁸ Et gelidum Borean egelidumque Notum,’—the frosty
 wind of the north, the warm breezes of the south-west. Augustus Caesar,
 a valetudinarian, ‘ perfundebatur egelida aqua’ (water warmed by ﬁre),
 ⁴ vel sole multo calefacta.’ In post-Augustan writers the word had a pre-

 4. Phrygii campi.—Bithynia was at one time a portion of the Persian
 province, or satrapy, of the Lesser Phrygia.

 5. Meam.- Niesen was the capital of Bithynia, according to Strabo
 (xii. p. 565). Strictly speaking, however, it long contested the honour
 of being the capital with Nicomedeia; and the 38th oration of Dion
 Chrysostom was written expressly to settle this long-standing dispute.
 His decision is, that Nieten was the second city of the province, Nico-
 medeia the real metropolis. The city was built on the site and ruins of

 the old town of Ancoro, or Helicore, by Antigonus the Great, who called
 it after himself, Antigoneia. But a few years later (3.0. 312—8) Lysima-
 chus, then master of Asia Minor, re-named it Nicaea. in honour of his wife
 Nicaea, a daughter of Antipater. Strabo, who saw Niclea about twenty years
 after Catullus was there, describes it as a stately and handsome city, built,
 like the other Macedonian capitals in Asia, in the form of a square, two
 miles in circumference. All its streets intersected one another at right-
 angles, and from a monument in the centre all its four gates could be
 seen. Nicaea, in common with the Lesser Asia generally, suffered
 severely from the civil wars between Caesar‘s death in 3.0. 48 and the
 battle of Actium in ne. 31, and was partly in ruins at the time when the
 younger Pliny was Proconsul of Bithynia (Plin. x. Epist. 42, 46, 48, 50).
 After the seat of empire was transferred to Constantinople, the importance
 of Nicaea increased; and there, in Ad). 325, was held the celebrated
 Council of Nicaea, which drew up the Nicene Creed. During the middle

 9. Comitum caetum-The contubernium to which Catullus belonged,—
 the mess. Young Romans of illustrious families, when they accompanied
 a general to the wars, or a proconsul to a province, for the purpose of
 gaining an insight into active service or camp life, lived in the same tent
 with their superior oﬁcer, and were denominated his ‘contubernales.’
 Compare Tacitus (Agricol. 5): ‘ Prima castrorum rudimenta in Britannia
 Suetonio Paulino approbavit, electus quem contubernio sestimaret.’ The
 members of a contubernium were called ‘cohors' (Catullus, xxviii.)=
 *Pisonis comites, cohors inanis.’ Compare Horace (Epist. i. 8. 14) : *Ut
 placeat juveni . . . utque colm-ti.’ The ‘ cmtus’ here is the cohors of the
 praetor Memmius (see Life of Catullus, p. 3, supra).

 VI. The poem (No. LXIV.) from which the following passage is
 extracted, is the Marriage-Song of Peleus and Thetis: ‘ Epithalamium
 Pelei et Thetidos,’ but though an episode, it really forms-the principal
 portion as well as the chief merit of the entire poem. The poem com-
 mences with the ship Argo on the celebrated expedition to Colchis in
 quest of the Golden Fleece. The Nereids.or sea-nymphs are eo much
 struck with the unwanted spectacle of a ship breaking the silence and
 solitude of their watery realm, that they all emerge from the deep to

 gaze upon it. Thetis, one of their number, becomes enamoured of Peleus,
 one of the Argonauts, and he, on his part, was instantly seized by a reci-
 procal passion. After this introduction the poet passes at once to the

 which is embroidered the story of Theseus and Ariadne. pThe Palace of
 Pharsalia is thus described:

 ‘ Ipsius at sedes, quacunqne opulenta recessit
 Reg-is, fulgenti splendent auro, atque argento,
 Candet ebur soiiis: collucent pocula mensis:
 Tots domns gaudet regali splendida gaze.’

 Next follows a description of the nuptial couch and its coverlid.

 ⁴ Pulvinar vero Diva: geniale locatur -
 Sedibus in mediis, Indo quod dente politnm
 Tincta legit roseo conchyli purpura fuco. t
 RZiifnglniiiiglliiEIEJ ﬁ‘m”

 Then follows the account of the story embroidered on the ‘ vestis,’ which
 was divided into two compartments. On the one was depicted the deser-
 tion of Ariadne by Theseus; on the other, the arrival of Bacchus and his
 Mamads, by whom she is home oﬂ‘ to become the wife of the wine-god,
 and a constellation.

 Ovid has treated the subject of Ariadne no less than four times :—(1) In
 an Epistle addressed to her by Theseus (supra, p. 77) on the subject of
 his abandonment of her (Heroid. 1.). (2) In the eighth book of the Meta-
 morphoses (174—181), the story serves merely as an introduction to the
 transformation of Ariadne’s crown into a star. (3) In the third book of
 the Fasti she deplores her twofold desertion by her mortal and immortal
 lover (459-516). And (4) in the first book of the Ara Amandi (527-
 564) Ovid emulates Catullus, and very nearly approaches him in excel-
 lence, in the description of the sudden contrast between the astonishment
 and desolation of Ariadne, and the rout and revelry of Bacchus and his
 crew.

 The reproaches which Ariadne addresses to the fugitive Theseus are
 imitated by Virgil in the remonstrances of Dido to AEneas preparing for
 ﬂight from Carthage (Eneid, iv. 365 £011.); by Ariosto in the tenth canto
 of the ‘ Orlando Furioso,’ where Olimpia, left on a desert island, pours forth
 her complaints against Bireno; and, again, by Tasso (Gierns. Liberat.
 canto xvi. 57-60), where Armida vents her wrath and scorn on Rinaldo.
 Catullus equals Virgil and surpasses his other imitatura, ancient and mo-
 dern, in his expression of the sentiments proper to the circumstances. In
 one stroke of pathos, indeed, he excels them all, viz. in breaking oﬁ‘ his
 narrative without a hint of Ariadne's ready acceptance of a new lover.
 The poet thus leaves her in full possession of the reader’s sympathy.

 The legend of Ariadne appears under various forms. In the most an-
 cient of them Theseus did not appear, and she is merely the heroine of a

 o 2

 Naxian story associated with the worship of Dionysos. The import of her
 name, much-pleasing, ἐρι-ἆνδάνω, is connected intimately with the joy of
 the wine-cup. The Athenians, always anxious to enlarge the cycle of their
 own mythology, coupled her with their native hero Theseus, and thus per.
 haps she became the daughter of an historical personage, Mines, king of
 Crete, and master of the [Egean and its islands. According to the Odyssey
 (xi. 325) Artemis slew Ariadne immediately on her arrival at Naxos. ln
 another legend it is said (Pherecydes ap. Schol. Odyss. xi. 321) that
 Theseus deserted her at the instigation of Athene, and that Aphrodite
 came and courted her with the promise of Dionysos for her spouse. He-
 siod (Theogon. 947) says nothing of Theseus, but merely that Dionysos
 espoused, and that Zeus conferred on Ariadne immortal life.

 Χρυσοκόμης δὲ Διόνυσος ξανθὴν Ἀριάδνην
 Κούρην Μίνωος, θαλερὴν ποιήσατ’ ἄκοιτιν.
 Τὴν δέ οἱ ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀγήρω θῆκε Κρονίων.

 l. Fluentiaano.—i. e. ‘ Fluentum sono.’ This word occurs only in Ca.
 tullus.

 Dice—Dis was an'elrly name of the island Naxos, one of the Cyclades
 groupe (Diodor. Sicul. iv. 61). It bore several names in ancient writers,
 e. y. Strongyle (Στρογγύλη), from its round form, it being about 19 miles
 in length, and 15 broad in its widest part; Dionysias (Διονυσίας), from
 its excellent wine, and its connection with the worship of Dionysos ς and
 the lesser Sicily (μικρὰ Σικελία), from the fertility of its soil (Plin. Nat.
 Hist. iv. 12, § 22). Dia was a favourite appellation for Naxos with the poets,
 e. y. Ovid (Metamorph. viii. 174) = ⁴ Protinus Egides, rapta Minoide,
 Dian, . . . vela dedit,’ etc. Carians were among its earliest inhabitants,
 from a chief of which nation it derived the name of Naxos. The island
 was sacred to Bacchus. Statius (Thebaid. vii. 685) enumerates the places
 sacred to the wine-god.

 ‘ Marcida te fractis planxerunt Ismara thyrsis=
 Te Tmolus, te Nysa feru, Theseaque Naxos,
 Et Thebana metu juratus in orgia Ganges.’

 2. Classe is here and irgﬁ-a put for nave, as Theseus sailed to Creta
 in a single ship—afterwards known as the Paralian galley, which long
 afterwards sailed annually from Athens to Delos, in memory of Theseus.
 after his victory over the Minotaur, having paid his epinician vows in
 that sacred island. Socrates remained in prison many days between his
 condemnation and the draught of hemlock, for while the Paralian galley
 was absent no sentence of death could be executed in Athens, because, it
 was said, the voyage to Delos commemorated the deliverance of the youths
 and maidens (‘ electos juvenes simul et decus innuptarum’), exacted
 from Athens by. Minos. This galley was said to be the very same ship in
 which Theseus had sailed, though it had been so often repaired as to give
 occasion to a celebrated question among the Sophists respecting its identity
 (Plutarch, Theseus. c. 23; Plato, Phaedon, c. 2).

 3. FuroreL—Furor is a word peculiarly appropriated to sudden passions
 —love,jea.lousy, wrath,etc.—Necdum . . . credit. ‘ And cannot yet believe
 her vision true.’—Fnllacs‘. The sleep which had beguiled her into false
 security.—Somno. ‘Ariadne dormiens’ was a favourite subject with ancient
 artists and poets. See Propertius, i. Eleg. 3:—

 ‘ Qualis Theses jacuit cedente carina
 Languida desertis Gnosia litoribus.¹

 Sola arena. The lonely sand-beach—Immemor (i.e. ‘ promissorum,’ und. in
 the promissa of the next verse), thoughtless. Theseus is generally de-
 scribed as abandoning Ariadne more from haste to return to Athens than
 from perﬁdy. In an Athenian legend the hero would naturally be repre-
 sented in the most favourable light. ‘ lmmemor’ occurs again ἰψα v., and
 there is an intimation of heedlessness in ‘ caeca caligine.’-Al9a adds an-
 other circumstance to the sola arena .- ‘arena,’ the sand; ‘ alga,’ the sea-
 weed that grew on it.—Ms’nm’s. Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, king
 of Creta-Samo eﬁgies. Ariadne gazing upon the vessel of Theseus in
 the oiling was a favourite subject with ancient sculptors.—Prospicit, like
 the preceding prospectus, is ‘ procul spectare’—gazing on the horizon.

 Italicus (Punic. ix. 527) ; ⁷ and Tasso (Gierus. Liberat.) ‘ In gran tempesta
 di pensieri ondeggia.‘ ~

 12. Nonjlavo retinent-Mn Dunlop (Hist. of Rom. Literature, i. p. 465)
 says: “ Never, perhaps, was there a ﬁner picture drawn of mental desola-
 tion. She was incapable of exhibiting violent signs of grief ι she neither
 beats her bosom, nor bursts into tears; but the diadem (mitram) which
 had compressed her locks—the light mantle which had ﬂoated round her
 form—the veil which had covered her bosom—all neglected and fallen at
 her feet, were the sport of the waves which washed the strand."—Flavo.
 Auburn was accounted by the Romans the most beautiful colour for the
 human hair. The same epithet is applied presently to the hair of Theseus
 -· ﬂavo in hospite.’ Apuleius (Metamorph. ii. p. 30, Bipont. ed.) describes
 auburn hair, ‘ut aurum coruscans in lenem mellis deprimitur umbram.⁷
 -Μίἱναηι, The mitra, when an article of male attire, was a brazen belt
 stuﬂ'ed with wool or tow, lined with leather, and worn between the breast-
 plate and the kilt or petticoat of the soldier; when of female dress, it was
 a kerchief worn on the head, and made of silk, linen, or coarser materials.
 The *mitra* is supposed to have come originally from Phrygia, and ac-
 cording to Servius (ad. JEneid, ix. 616) was synonymous with ‘ calantica.’
 ——Strophio. ‘ Strophium' was the sash or ribbon worn by unmarried women
 immediately under the bosom. Non. Mareellin. (p. 538. 7) says : ‘ Stro-
 phium est fascia brevis, qua: virginalem tumorem cohibet papillarum.’
 Sometimes it means a ﬁllet worn on the head of priests. Strophium
 (στρόφιον), an imperfectly naturalized word, did not retain its place in the
 Latin language, and was supplanted by fascia, which is used in exactly the
 same sense. Comp. Martial, Epigram. xiv. 134: ‘ Fascia crescentes dominae
 compesce papillas.’

 16. Fluctus salis alludebant-Cicero (Nat. Deor. ii. 39) employs nearly
 the same words for a similar image: ‘Mare terram appetens litoribus
 alludit.’ Vicem : the circumstances or condition of her garments, etc.

 20. hiemavit-Dravo beside herself, terriﬁed extremely. So below,
 ⁶ externata malo,’ made wild by misery and misfortune. ‘ Externare’ is a
 word used by poets only, and seldom even by them. Ovid employs it,
 Metamorph. i. 641; xi. 77, 342. It is a strengthened form of ‘ex-
 terrere.’ .

 21. Erycina.-Mount Eryx was in the west of Sicily, about six miles
 from the promontory of Drepanum, and two from the seacoast. It was an
 isolated peak rising abruptly from undulating hills, and therefore conspi-
 cuous as a sea-mark. The mountain derived its name from Eryx, son of
 Poseidon, king of the Elymians. On its summit stood a temple of Aphro-
 dite (Venus). founded, according to the current legend, by her son Eneas,
 whence the goddess is frequently called Erycina by the Latin poets.
 (Comp. Strabo, xiii. p. 608 ; Virgil, IEneid, v. 795; Horace, Carm. ii. 33.)

 22. Illa tempestate . . . quo tempore.-⁴ Tempestas’=uaupbs, the mo-
 ment; ‘ tempus’ = χρόνος, the space of time in which the moment is a
 point. Cf. lxvi. 2: ‘ Qua rex tempestate—vastatum feros iverat Assyrios.’

 23. Pines-The Peirreus was the principal harbour of Athens. It really
 consisted of three ports (Thucyd. i. 93: χαφίον λιμένας ἕχον τρεῖς
 αὐτοφυεῖς). Themistocles was the ﬁrst to perceive the natural advantages
 of the peninsula of Peimus, as, before his time, Athens had only one har-
 bour, Phalerum. He surrounded it with strong walls, and connected
 the peninsula with Athens. The citadel of Peirieus was Munychia. Hence
 Catullus anticipates in speaking of the Peiraeus as a haven in the time of
 Theseus. ‘ ’

 24. hausti-Meteilus, hauh-Gortynia tecta. The royal palace in
 Gortyna, the second city of Crete. Γορτὺν in the Homeric poems. (Comp.
 Il. ii. 646 with Odyss. iii. 294.) Gortyna stood on a plain watered by
 the river Lethaeus, and was about eleven miles. from the Libyan Sea.

 25. Nam perhibente-Here begins an episode to account for the ﬁrst
 relations of Theseus with Creta, Minos, and Ariadne.

 26. Androyeonea: media. — Androgeus, son of Minos and Pasiphae
 perished in battle with the Athenians, or (for the traditions of him are
 very various) was slain by the contrivance of Egeus, king of Athena.
 Minos made war upon the Athenians, and having conquered, imposed on
 them a yearly tribute of youths and maidens, who were devoured by the
 Minotaur—a monster with a human body and a bull’s head, and who was
 kept in the labyrinth of Cuossus. Theseus undertook to deliver his country
 from this odious tribute, and, by the help of Ariadne, slew the monster.
 By an inversion common in legends, Androgeus was, at a later period,
 worshiped in Attica as a hero, and an altar erected to him in the port of
 Phalerum (Pausan. i. l, 5 4). Propertius (El. ii. 1, 649) alludes to a story
 of Androgeus having been restored to life by Esculapius (see art.
 Ἀνδρινγεῶνια in Smith‘s Dictionary of Antiquities).

 27. Electos juvenem-According to Virgil (Eneid, v. 20) the victims
 were chosen by lot.

 ‘Turn pendere panes

 Corpora natorum: stat ductis sortibus urna.’
 See Ovid, Metamorph. vii. 456; viii. 153.—-Dem innuptarum. Decoras
 νπὲῗοῖὰίηοταανομ-Τὴε monster is· a frequent subject with ancient artists.
 Sometimes he is represented alone m the labyrinth, sometimes engaged in
 conﬂict with Theseus. Both coins and authors, however, diﬁ'er as to his
 actual form. Some describe him as having a bull’s head and a man’s body,
 others with a human head and an ox’s body.

 ‘H n δόμων ἔντοσθε φίλῃ παρὰ μητέρι μίμνει
 Οὔπω ἔργ’ εἰδυῖα πολυχρύσου Ἀφροδίτης.

 38. heroica-The river Eurotas was the principal river in ancient La-
 conia. It is formed by the junction of many copious springs, and ﬂows
 throughout the valley bounded by the mountain ridges of Parnon and Tay-
 getus. The Eurotas rises in the mountains which bound to the south the
 plains of Asea and Megalopolis in Arcadia. Being fed by mountain torrents,
 it was alternately a broad and rapid stream, and a sluggish and shallow
 one, according to the season of the year. The Greek poets (Theognis,
 785; Euripid. lphigen. in Aul. 179) give it the epithet of δονακοτρόφος,
 or sonuerim, from the sedge and reeds which occupy its banks and the
 shallower parts of its stream.

 39. Dietinetoa colores.—Flowers of various hues. Educit is here used for
 educat. Edric-gre and edücüre, weak and strong forms of the same word,
 are often interchanged by Catullus and his contemporaries, e.g. (xix. l4):
 ' Uva pampinea rubens educate sub umbra,’ for ‘ educta.’ Varro (ap. Non.
 p. 447) thus distinguishes these words: ‘ Educit obstetrix, educat nutrix.’

 44. More eupalhait auri-Catullus (lxiv.) speaks of the paleness of
 a gilt statue: ‘Hospes, inanrata pallidior statua.’ Comp. Ovid, Metam.

 ‘ O terque quaterque beati,
 Queis ante on patrum, Troja sub mmnibus altis
 Contigit oppetere ’ (ac. mortem) ς
 but not with equal propriety of ‘ pmmia.’

 47. Mirm-An regarded Theseus, Ariadne’s vows had not been in
 vain, since he slew the Minotaur; but as respected herself they were
 ‘frustra,’ since his success was the cause of her misfortunes.

 48. Swpendil.—Smcipere vota is the more usual phrase, but in this
 passage there is much force in the substitution for it of ‘ suspendere’, since
 the latter word intimates both the agitation of Ariadne—her quivering lip
 while inarticuiately offering vows, and the practice of suspending in tem-
 ples (comp. Horace, Carin. i. 5. l3) pictures or other mementos of those
 who had been saved from signal perils at sea.

 49. Tatum—Any lofty mountain would have answered the purpose of

 for the clue (plum) would have strayed from the path, and then, though
 he had killed the Minotaur, Theseus would have been detained for ever in
 the labyrinth. The Latin poets generally, and some of the later Greek
 writers also speak of the Cretan labyrinth. But this is a mere poetic
 ﬁction: no such ediﬁce ever existed in that island. The real Labyrinth
 of Egypt is the source of the invention. See Hmch's Greta, i. p. 56 foll.

 69. Mine . . . ac . . . conscendere-This interchange of the past and
 present tenses, though joined by s copula, is warranted by all the best
 writers, e.g. Livy (iii. 46) : ‘ Domum se recepit, collegisque in castra scribit.¹

 involving, an it did to heathen imaginations, long wanderings on the banks
 of the Stygian river, is thus explained by Virgil (Eneid, vi. 326) :—

 Tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt.’

 98. Dumm te perunit-In addition to the expansions of this idea by
 later poets, mentioned in the Introduction to this Epithalamium, compare
 the following passage from Tibullus, Eleg. iii. 4, 35 foll. ·

 ⁴ Nam te nee vasti genuernnt equora ponti,

 100. Syrtis . . . Scylla . . . Charybdim-Syrtis is a general name for a de-
 solate and sandy shore, from the Arabian sert, ‘ a desert.’ Properly it be-
 longs to two broad and shallow gnlfs, Syrtis Major and Minor, in the Libyan
 sea, on the north coast of Africa. The smaller Syrtis was considered by
 ancient navigators unapproachable, by reason of its sunken and shelving
 rocks; and into the latter small craft alone ventured. The shores of both
 these gulfs were nearly as perilous since the sea, since they who landed on
 them were, at most seasons of the year, liable to be buried by cloud-like
 masses of sand driven by the wind (see Pomponius Mela, i. 7, and
 Diodor. Sicnlul, xx. 41, and comp. Sallust, Jugurth. 79). Either, how-
 ever, the sea has become deeper oﬁ’ the Regio Syrtica, or modem sailors
 are holder or more skilful than the ancients, for the reports of modern
 travellers do not quite warrant the ill-repute of this coast.—Scylla, in
 mythology, was, according to Homer (Odyss. xii. 73 and 235), a hideous
 monster, who barked like a dog, and had twelve feet, six long necks and
 mouths, each of which contained three rows of sharp teeth—hence vora-s*
 in the text. In geography, it was the name of a rock situated between
 Italy and Sicily. Her parentage is variously given by diﬁ'erent poets, but
 the Homeric is the oldest known form of the legend. Virgil (Eneid, vi.
 286) mentions several Scyllae in Eadem-Charybdis, in mythology, was
 the daughter of Poseidon and Gals (i. e. oﬂ‘spring of sea and earth) who was
 struck with thunder by Zeus for stealing oxen from Heracles (Servius ad
 AEneid. iii. 420). In geography, it was the name of a rock at a short
 distance from Scylla. The alternative of danger between these rocks is
 *expressed in the proverbial line, at one time ascribed to Horace, but
 really occurring in the ‘Alexandre'is ’ of Philippus Gualterus, who wrote
 about an. 1280:

 ‘ lncidit in Scyllam qui vult vith Charybdim.’
 101. Pro dulci vitm-I. e. quam servatam a me accipit.

 303. Print—Austen, harsh; originally primitive: ‘Priscul Cato’
 (Horace, Carm. iii. 21. ll). Prisons is the name of an old Italian race.
 ‘ Prisca gens inortalium ’ came to mean primitive. old-fashioned. Prisons
 was a surname of the Gens Servilia and other old families at Rome.

 105. Famularer ma labora-Among the Greeks generally the con-
 dition of even free-horn women so nearly approached that of meniala,
 that when they lost their freedom, through the accidents of war or
 captivity by pirates, they at once subsided into the condition of slaves.
 Thus Agamemnon (Iliad, i. 30) says that his mistress Chryseis, though
 daughter of the priest of Apollo, shall weave at his loom; and Hector

 the aid stforded by Ariadne to Theseum-Dira stipendia. The cruel tribute
 of youths and maidens paid annually; supra, v. 27 : ‘ Electos juvenes simul
 et decus innupterum.’ ‘ Stipendium,’ in its original sense, means a penalty
 imposed on the vanquished (stips, pendo) e. g. ‘ Pmni stipendia pendunt.’
 Ennius ap. Varro. L. L. v. 36, § 50. Hence it came to signify punish-
 ment generally, as Horace, Epod. xvii. 36: ‘ Qua; ﬁnis aut quod me manet
 stipendium] A more recent meaning of the word is the ⁶ pay of soldiers.’
 119. Nam quo me rqferam.--Another imitation of Euripides (Medea,

 120. Idomem'as mortise—The hills of Crete. Idomeneus, grandson of
 Minos and Pasiphae, led the Cretan forces in the Trojan war, and greatly
 distinguished himself in it. The story of his later life resembles that of
 the Hebrew J ephtheh, at least in post-Homeric tradition. Having vowed
 to Poseidon that, if delivered from a storm at sea, he would sacriﬁce to
 him whatever he should meet on ﬁrst landing in his kingdom, he was
 constrained by his vow to offer up his own son. For this offence Crete
 was visited by a pestilence, and his subjects banished him. Idomeneus
 then settled in Calabria, or, according to another account, in Colophon, in
 Asia Minor. His tomb, however, was shown at Cnossus, in Crete, where
 he and his half-brother Meriones, who followed him to Troy, were wor-
 shiped as local heroes (Diodor. SicuL v. 79). There is an anachronism
 in Ariadne’s calling the Cretan mountains Idomenios, since they cannot

 122. Gimme—This is not simply for wenn—J metri causs,'—but a
 strengthening οἰ the previous interrogation: ⁴ That father whom I, of my
 own accord, abandoned.’ So quine, in the next line but one, ‘ that faithless
 husband.’ Compare with this passage Ovid, ‘ Medea to Jason,’ 109—116.

 131. Fuse—Exhausted by fear, watching, hunger, etc.

 134. Facta.—Facihorn‚ impia facta. , _

 135. Eumem'des.—Also called Erinnyes by the Greek, and Dine or Furia
 by the Roman poets, were originally the personiﬁcation of curses pronounced
 on guilty persons or nations. The word implying ' the well-meaning’ or
 ‘the soothed’ goddesses, is a softening of their earlier appellation: Erin-
 nyes, ‘the searchers of guilt,’ or ‘the angry’ (θεαὶ). The crimes which they
 were supposed to visit with their scourge were disobedience to parents,
 violation of social duties,—e. q. respect to age, suppliants. and guests,—
 minder, and, as in Ariadne’s case, perjury. In the Homeric poems
 the Eumenides have neither name, number, nor parentage. Hesiod,
 makes them to be the offspring of Ge (earth), engendered by blood-drops
 from the body of Uranus (heaven). The tragedians derive them from
 Night and Earth, and invest them with hideous forms: a. 9. they are
 winged beings, with snakes entwined in their hair, clad in black, and blood
 dripping from their eyes. On the Athenian theatre, however, they up.

 peered under a somewhat milder aspect as σεμναὶ deal—venerable god-
 desses, maidens of grave and solemn mien attired as hnntresses (κυνη-
 qiman), with reference to their chase of the guilty, retaining, indeed,
 their head-bands of snakes, and bearing in their hands a serpent or a torch.
 The Eumenides were worshiped in several places, but with most aolemnity
 at Athens, where they had a sanctuary and grove near the Ampagus, and
 where they were held in awe even in the ﬁrst century of the Christian
 era, since it was popularly said that the Emperor Nero dared not visit
 Athens, during his progress through Greece, because of the presence of
 the Eumenides, as he, like Orestes, was a matricide. The usual victims
 offered to them were black sheep, and a drink composed of honey, milk,
 and water, called nephah’a. lt is strange to read in [Elian (Hist. Anim.
 x. 33) that among the things offered to these grim beings were white
 turtle-doves and the ﬂowers of the narcissus. As the legend of Theseus
 and Ariadne combines a Bacchic with an Attic myth, there is much pro-
 priety in this appeal to the dread avengers of perjury.

 136. Empimteepreportat.-⁸Expirat et pra-,fert =’ breathes forth and

 137. Huc, huc adenine—Comp. Seneca, ‘Medea,’ l3:

 Atram cruentis manibus amplexu facem.’

 Id. Hercules Furens, vv. 85-88.

 ‘ Acer in extremis ossibus husit amor.’

 139. Inops.——Spei, auxilii, consilii ;—hopeless, helpless, purposeless.

 143. honestet-Funere incestet—as Virgil, Eneid, vi. 150, ‘Incestat
 funere classem.’ ‘ Funestare ’ is not used by authors of the Augustan age,
 but reappears in Juvenal. Sat. viii. 18,

 146. Annuit . . . mundum-This passage is imitated from the celebrated
 verses in the lliad, i. 528, from which Phidias is said to have derived his
 conception of his statue of Zeus erected at Elis.

 148. Mundus, like the Greek κόσμος, is here the ‘ o’erarching ﬁrmament.’

 149. Ceca mentem caligine-Here also Theseus is represented as for-
 saking Ariadne rather from improvidence and haste to return to Athens
 than perﬁdy. See note supra on *immemor juvenisJ-Comitvm Obsitua
 would be the more usual word.

 151. Quos mandata-Plutarch, ‘ Life of Theseus : ’ ‘ There appearing no
 hopes of safety for the youths, they sent out a ship with a black sail, as
 carrying them to certain ruin. But when Theseus encouraged his father
 ,by his conﬁdence of success against the Minotaur, he gave another sail, a
 white one, to the pilot, ordering him, if he brought Theseus back safe, to
 hoist the white; but if not, to sail into harbour with the black one in
 token of misfortune. . . . When they drew near to Attica, both Theseus
 and the pilot were so transported with joy that they forgot to hoist the
 white sail, and Egens in despair threw himself from the rock and was
 dashed to pieces.’

 153. Fortune—As yet there was but one harbour at Athens—Pha-
 lerum—which Catullus deuominates ¹the port of Erechtheus, an ancient

 134 nous 0N

 king of the land. By the advice of Themistocles, in a.c. 483, after
 after the Persians had begun to assail European Greece, Peiraeus was for-
 tiﬁed and connected by the long walls with the city. The rock from
 which Egens threw himself is supposed to have been the height after-
 wards occupied by Munychia, the citadel of the Peimus.—Clani‚ as in v.
 2, is for Mes.

 154. Namque jerunt-The order of this sentence is involved—‘ Namque
 ferunt [dignum] cum [ille] natum mcenia Dive [Athens, sacred to Athene]
 linquentem concrederet ventis [to winds and waves], complexum eum-
 [with his last embrace] [dum complectebatur] talis mandata dedisse
 [proﬁciscenti] juveni.’

 157. Unice.—‘Unicus,’ only and most beloved—‘ qui in re aliqua sui simi-
 lem non habet, pracstantissimus.’ The word is thus deﬁned by Lueretius,
 Rar. Nat. ii. 543: ⁸ Unica res quamdam nativo corpore sola, Cui similis toto
 terrarum non sitin orbe.’ Catullus (lxxiii. 6) combines ‘unus’ and ‘nnicus,’
 ‘ Qui me unum atque unicum smicum habuit.’

 159. Reddite . . . smote—Egan had long supposed himself a childless
 man. See Euripides, ‘ Medea.’ Theseus had been brought up by his grand-
 father Pittheus at Trcezene, and did not o to Athens until he had achieved
 many heroic sdventures, and there foun his father advanced in years and
 surrounded by enemies. Shortly after his arrival the collectors of the
 Cretan tribute came for their annual payment of youths and maidens;
 hence [Egeus is made to say, ‘ Cogor in dubios dimittere casns,’ since the
 Athenians insisted on his taking his share of the national victim-tax to
 the Minotaur.

 160. Fervida virtue—Theseus volunteered to be one of the seven
 youths, who otherwise were chosen by lot.-Non gaudena. Egeus did not
 share in his son’s conﬁdence of success.

 166. Canitiem . . .fedam.-To throw dust on the head, as an expres-
 sion of grief, was a custom of Asia, that passed with other Eastern usages
 to eastern Europe. Mezentius, in the Eneid (x. 844), when he sees the
 body of his son borne by his comrades, ‘canitiem multo deformat pul-
 vere.’ Comp. Iliad, xviii. 23; Odyss. xxiv. Siti-Infecta, dyed with
 black.— Vega. The metaphor is not very precise: ‘navita vayua’ in Tibullus,
 Eleg. i. 40. 41, sud ‘ mercator vaqus⁷ in Horace, Ara Poet. 117.

 169. Carbaeus lbera-»Spain produced hemp, out of which the sails of
 ships were made, and a plant called ‘spartum,’ out of which was spun rope
 for the rigging, ‘ tunes Iberici.’ Horace, Epod. iv. 3.—0bccurafmuyine.
 Virgil, Georg. i. 467, uses the same words metaphorically of the sun
 obscured by clouds: ‘Cum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit,’ pro
 caligine. '

 170. [toni-At Iton, or Itonns, a town of Phthiotis, in Thessaly, was a
 celebrated temple of Athene, whose worship, under the name of the
 Itonian Athene, had been brought thither by the Baotians, when expelled
 from their original homes in Thessaly. Hence Minerva is called ‘ sancti
 incola Itoni.’—Funestam vestem, the garb of mourning. the black sail.—
 Candida vela. This legend was evidently widely dispersed, since it was very
 variously reported: e. g. Simonides (ap. Plutarch. Thes. 17) described the
 sail as of a crimson colour; e. g. 'O δὲ Σιμωνίδης οὐ λευκόν φησὶν εἶναι τὸ
 δοθὲν ὑπὸ τοῦ Αἰγέως, ἀλλὰ φοινίκεον ἱστίον, ὑγρῷ πεφυρμένον πρινὸυ

 194. At parte ex alim-The poet now proceeds to describe the op-
 posite compartment of the vestis,—-‘ priscis hominum variata ﬁguris’ (v.
 50),——-whicb represented the arrival of Bacchus, and the release of
 Ariadne from Nasos.—Florem. Ente, juventute. The Theban Bacchus
 was represented by the Greek artists, and especially by Praxiteles, as
 ‘ ever fair and ever young.’ Comp. Tibullus, Eleg. i. 4. 37:

 ‘ Solis Interns est Baccho Phoeboque juventas,
 Nam decet intonsus crinis utrumque deum.’

 ⁴ Dionysus,’ says Mr. Keightley (Mythology, p. 216, 2nd ed.), ‘ was repre-
 sent-ed in a variety of modes and characters.’ There was the ‘bearded ’
 Bacchus, calm, draped, and wise; the ‘ horned ’ Bacchus, half bestial, half
 divine. The Theban Bacchus, however, ⁴ always appears with the delicate
 lineaments of a maiden; his whole air and gait are eEeminate; his long
 ﬂowing hair is, like that of Apollo, collected behind his head, wreathed
 with ivy or a ﬁllet; he is either naked, or wrapped in a large cloak, and
 the nebris [νεβρίς] is sometimes ﬂung over his shoulders; he carries a
 crook or thyrse, and a panther generally lies at his feet.’ Bacchus, it
 may be observed, is merely an epithet of Dionysus: it signiﬁes the ‘ noisy’
 god. Comp. Dryden, ‘ Ode on St. Cecilia’s Day :’——

 ⁴ The jolly god in triumph comes;
 Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.’

 —Volitabat. Hurrying onward, speeding from realm to realm. Bacchus
 possessed many of the attributes of the Egyptian Osiris, one of which was
 roaming over the earth. In the ‘ Bacchas* of Euripides, 12—22, the god
 describes himself as having traversed Asia and Arabia, establishing every-
 where his dances and festivals.

 195. Silena-The word Silenus is probably derived from ἵλλω, εἰλέω,

 ‘to roll,’ expressive of the motion of streams. In Latin silanus is a tube
 or pipe for conveying water. Lucretius, vi. 1263: ‘Corpora n'lzmos ad
 aquarum strata jacebant.’ Hence the connection between Bacchus and
 Silenus, who was said to be the son, or, according to Pindar (Fragm. 73),
 the husband of a water-nymph (Nah): they were all deities representing
 moisture. There were many Sileni; e. g. Marsyas is called a Silen by
 Herodotus. Hence, in this passage, they are spoken of in the plural. The
 best-known of them, the Silenus κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, was an old, ﬂat-nosed, bald-
 headed man, riding on a broad-backed ass, very drunk, but also very wise.
 Hence Socrates, in Xenophon, Symposium, v. § 7, compares himself to
 Silenus, because he was bald, ﬂat-nosed, wise, and, although no drunkard,
 yet able to drink wine freely.—Nysigenia. Nysa, whether a city on the
 continents of Europe and Asia, or an island in the Indian Ocean, was
 “if”? ‘Sdbiif§‘°.£if§h§§3?f 35s§“°$‘.“‘.’.l3”12°i§3§ 323133.? SET;

 Nysa. In connection with the legend of the Theban Bacchus was Nysa,
 a village in Bceotia, on Mount Helicon, Strabo, ix. p. 405. Milton, Par.
 Lost, iv. 275, will illustrate this passage of Catullus; the Nyseian isle he
 mentions was in Libya: .

 136 Nous ou

 ⁸ That Nyseian isle '
 Girt with the river Triton, where old Chem,
 Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,
 Hid Amalthea and her ﬂorid son,
 Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea’s eye.’

 197. Lymphata.—Lympha is nymphs, water. ‘The dentals T and
 N are sometimes converted into L' (Donaldson’s ‘Varrouianus,’ p. 255,
 2nd ed.). Lymphah' and lymphatici signify persons ‘ mente capti,’ enthusi-
 astic, insane, νυμφόληπτοι, caught by the nymphs. It is not impos.
 sible that certain eﬁ'ects—e. y. in cases of hydrophobia, caleuture, etc.—
 of water may have led to this secondary sense of lympha. Ovid (Meta-
 morph. xi. 3) has-‘lymphata pectors.’—Bacchantes, noisily shouting.—
 Capita ivyfectentes. Comp. Cstullus, 23, *Ubi capita Maznades vi
 jacinnt hederigene.’

 199. Thyrum-The θύρσος was a light stef surrounded with ivy and
 vine-branches, and terminated in s pine-cone. The more recent Greek
 writers and some of the Latin poets supposed it to have been a 'spear con-
 cealed in ivy, or having the point hidden by a cone: thus ‘ tecta cuspide,’
 in the present passage; and Seneca (Hercules Furens) says, ‘Tectam
 virenti cuspidem thyrso gereus=¹ on the other hand, Ovid (Metamorph.
 xi. 9) describes the thyrsus as pointless:

 ‘ Hastam-Qum foliis praesuta notam sine vulnere fecit;’

 and Virgil (Eneid, vii. 390) terms the thyrsus ‘ mollis.’ Diodorus Siculus
 (iii. c. 64) says that the followers of Bacchus carried spears covered with
 ivy instead of thyrsi; and Lucian describes the Bacchauals as κιττᾷ
 ἑσστεμμέναι, νεβρίδας ἐνημμέναι, δόρατά τινα μικρὰ ἔχουσαι, ἀσίδηρα
 κιττοπσιητὰ καὶ ταῦτα (Bacchus, c. i. p. 292, Lehm.). (See Donaldson,
 New Cratylus, p. 505, 2nd ed.)

 290. Pars e divulsa-Compare Euripid. ‘ Bacchse,‘ v. 736 foll, to whom
 Catullus is indebted in this pasaage.—Ob:cura, hidden by vine-leaves, so
 that no uninitiated person might discern the orgia, Le. sacred words or
 symbolic actions.—Orgia are sacred rites performed under the stimulant
 of religious frenzy (ὀργὴ). The word ὄργια, orgia, signiﬁes secret rites, or
 worship practised by the initiated alone, just like μυστήρια. It is applied,
 in the Homeric Hymn to Ceres, 274, 476, to the secret worship of Deme-
 ter; to that of the Cabeiri and Demeter Achaia (Herodotus, ii. 5l,v. 61) ς
 but the word is usually conﬁnedto the tumultuous ceremonies of Bacchus.
 Rage, frenzy, is a secondary meaning of ὀργὴ, whence ὄργια is probably
 derived ; its first sense being an emotion of the mind (ὂρέ-γω), a tendency
 to the surface, an impulse. Ὀρ-για may indeed come from ἔργον, as ἔρδειν
 was used of performing sacred rites, ‘ sacra facereJ-Procerie, hands
 stretched out.— Tympana, tambourine. Comp. ‘ Atys :'

 ‘Niveis citata cepit manibus leve tympanum,

 the ‘aurum barbaricum,’ Eneid, ii. 504. Lucian describes the instru-
 ments used by the worshipers of the Syrian goddess (c. l2) in very
 similar terms to those used by Catullus of the anads; 9-9. ὁ δὲ

 VII. The Manlius to whom this elegy is addressed is the same person
 for whom Catullus composed the beautiful epithalamium (LXI.) on the
 occasion of the marriage of ‘ Manlius with Julia.’ That he was a member
 of the noble house of the Manlii Torquati there is no doubt, but nothing
 more can be told of him. The intimacy of the poet with his friend or
 patron is beautifully and clearly expressed. The el’egy is an answer to a
 letter of Manlins desiring Catullus to console him in some sudden and
 severe aﬂiiction, and the poet replies that although gratitude and sﬁ‘ection
 prompt him to comply with the request, he can respond to it imperfectly.
 since he himself also is overwhelmed with grief on account of the recent
 death of his brother. Muretus considered this poem as among the most
 exquisite of the compositions of Catullus, and perhaps without a rival in
 the elegiac literature of Rome. ‘ Pulcherrima omnium haec elegia est,
 atque hand scio, an ulla pulchrior in omni Latina lingua reperiri queat.
 Nam et dictu purissima est: et mira quadam aﬁ'ectuum varietate per-
 mista oratio : et tot ubique aspersa verborum ac sententiarum lumina, ut
 ex hoc uno poemate perspicere liceat, quantum Catullus ceteris in hoe
 genere omnibus praestare potuerit, si vim ingenii sui ad illud excolendum
 contulisset.’

 l. Fortuna, casm-Fortuna. general calamity; cm, the particular one
 for which Manlius required consolation.

 2. .Eps's!ols'um.—The brief little letter. This word occurs in this passage
 alone of Catullus, and is among the many indications of his familiarity
 with Greek. Probably he wrote ἐπιστόλιον, as we write lapis, emmi, etc.,
 without attempting to naturalize it.

 8. Mortis limine restituam-This passage is imitated by the author of
 the poem called ‘ Culex,’ ascribed to Virgil:

 texta, or gown of boyhood, was a very solemn one; it was performed in
 presence of the Lsres, sometimes even in the Capitol (Valer. Maxim. v. 4.
 54). The investiture was generally followed by worship in a temple.
 The usual season for it was at the Festival of Bacchus, in the month of
 March (see Ovid, Fasti, iii. 771). Taga pura, Cicero ad Attic. v. 20,
 libera, Ovid, Trist. iv. 10. 28, are expressions equivalent with that of
 vestis ura.

 19.pS!udium.—‘Lusﬂs,’ understood in the preceding ⁶ lusi,’ the pursuit
 proper to the ﬂowery season of youth—Lucia fratema mors==luctus ob
 mortem fratris.

 20-26. O misero frater . . . delicias animi, v. 20-26.-The grace, ten.
 derness, and beauty of these seven verses have attracted universal admira-
 tion, and imitations of them are frequent in modern Latin poets. Lotichius.
 for example (Ecl. i. v. 32), has transferred an entire line, changing only a
 single word, and the change is not an improvement; viz. ‘ Omnia tecum
 gns fuymnt gaudia nostra ;⁷ and in Eleg. vi. 39, 40, has closely copied

 atullus: '

 ⁴ In studium lususque meos, tu gaudia vitae
 Omnia fregisti morte, Stibare, tna.’

 Catullus always writes well, because he felt deeply, on the subject of his
 brother’s death. The poem entitled ‘Inferiw ad Fratris Tumulum⁷ is
 another beautiful and aﬂ'ectionate tribute to his memory.

 29. Scriptorum non magna est copim-This and the three following lines
 aﬁ‘ord us some hint as to the mode in which Catullus composed poetry.
 He cannot write so well as usual, he tells Manlius, because his library is
 at Rome, and only one case or box of books has followed him into the
 country. When surrounded by his books, which we cannot doubt were
 Greek, he studied the originals before he transferred their spirit into the
 Latin tongue. Nor was he singular in this practice. Horace, in like
 manner, meditated on Alcaeus, and Virgil on the Iliad and the ‘Argonauts'
 of Apollonius of Rhodes, before they embodied their feelings in lyric or
 heroic measures. Our own poet Gray always studied Spenser attentively
 before he sat down to the work of composition, and Milton enriched even
 his opulent imagination by daily reading, or hearing read, some passage
 of Homer, Ovid, or ‘the lofty grave tragedians.’ The true poet can
 borrow rightfully, because he can also richly repay the loan.

 30. Hoc ﬁt quod Rome civimua.—‘ This is one consequence of my ,
 permanent abode being at Rome; at my villa in Sirmio l have no more
 books with me than one capsula will contain.’ Capsa and its diminutive,
 capsula, are cases, of cylindrical form, for books. Observe that ancient
 books were rolls of parchment or papyrus. Capsula is a portable book-
 case used by travellers, and a satchel in which boys carried their books __
 to school. The satchels of boys of wealthy families were borne by a slave
 named capsur-ius, Jnvenal, Sat. x. 117: ‘Quem sequitur custos angustae
 vernula capsse.’ Horace, like Catnllus, took with him to the seaside, or
 into the country, a few favourite authors. Horace, Epist. i. 2. 2 ; ii. 3. ll.

 31. Carpitur ataa=carpit se.--Wears itself away.

 33. Quod cum ita sih-This is an oratorical phrase, usually employed
 at the commencement of the peroration of a speech: “ Quae cum ita
 q sint, Quirites?”——Nolim statuae. ‘Thinlr not, I pray, that my declining

 to comply with your request arises either from a churlish temper (mente

  

 cs'runnus. 139

 molium) or from a heart void of generous impulse,’ animo non satis in-
 yenuo.

 35. Utriusque petilL—‘ Either of your requests.’ Manlius had asked Ca-
 tnllns to send him either an original poem, or some verses by other writers
 appropriate to his sorrow. For the one purpose his own bereavement
 disabled him, for the other he had no books proper for the task at hand.

 36. Ultra is sometimes used as synonymous with «ponte, but there is a
 diﬁ‘erence in their signiﬁcation, corresponding to the difference of their
 roots. Sponte means that a person does what is expected οἰ him; ultro,
 that he does something more than was looked for, or could fairly be de-
 manded of him. ‘ An accurate examination of the passages in which ultro
 occurs,’ says Dr. Donaldson (Varronianus, p. 314—15, 2nd ed.), ‘ enables
 us to trace it back to its original mesning,’-——‘ to a place beyond,’—still
 found in such phrases as ‘ultro istum a me,’—-‘ take him far from me ’
 (Plant. Capt. iii. 4-19). ‘ His lacrymis vitam damus et miserescimus ultro ’
 (A3neid, ii. 145), ‘.to these tears we grant his life, and pity him besides.’
 Tacitus, Ann. xiii. 23: ‘Commotis qui aderant, ultroque spiritu· ejus
 mitigantibus,’—‘ when those who stood by were affected, and, what is
 more, actively bestirred themselves to pacify her wrath.’ Horace (Cm-m.
 iv. 4. 51) says: ‘ Sectamur ultro quos opimus fallere et eﬁ'ugere est
 triumphns,’-—‘ contrary to all expectation, we pursue when we ought to
 be only too happy to escape.’ In the present passage ultra means, ‘I
 should have been the ﬁrst to oﬁ’er you consolation, had it been now in my
 power to aﬂ'ord it.’

 37. Nonppnm reticere.——‘ But though I can neither compose not copy
 verses at this moment, neither can I be silent on my obligations to
 Manlius.

 42. Charta αισι-ί The poem even when old.’ Anm is used as an adjec-
 tive by Catullns,lxxvii. 10: ‘ fama anus ς’ comp. ‘terra anns,’ Plin. N. Η.

 desolation is a common one with poets, e. y.—

 And lazy spiders ﬁlled the hilt with cobwebs ?’

 45. Amathusia.—Aphrodite, or Venus, and Adonis were worshiped at
 Amathusy an ancient town on the south coast of Cyprus (old Limasal).
 The surrounding country was celebrated for its wheat (Strabo, p. 340)
 and its minerals, *foecundam Amathunta metalli’ (Ovid, Metamorph. x.

 140 NOTES 0:»:

 220). Long aﬁer the other Phoenician towns of the island had become
 Greek, Amathus retained its primitive Oriental manners and worship.

 47. Trinacn'a rupea-Mount Etna, in Sicily. Sicily is called the tri-
 angular island on account of its three promontories, which may be con-
 sidered as forming the angles of a triangle. viz. Cape Pelorus to N.E.,
 Cape Pachynus to S.E., and Lilybaeum to W. Catullus was living when
 a great eruption of Etna occurred, at the outbreak of the civil war between
 Caesar and Pompeius, 8.0. 49. ,

 48. Lympha Malim-The Maliacus Sinus (Gulf of Zittim') was a long
 gulf of the sea, lying between the coast of Thessaly and the northern coast
 of the Epicnemidian Locrians. It derived its name from the country of the
 Malians situated at its head.

 59. Pollucis . . . (lastaria-Castor and Pollux had, among other titles,
 that of ἀρωγόναυται, the seaman’s defenders. Certain meteoric lights, seen
 after storms, were believed by the ancients to indicate the presence of
 these deities; hence they are called by Horace (Cm-m. i. 3) ‘ lucida sidera.’
 Comp. Euripides, Helen. 1495 foll.

 63. Scabra robiqine.-Comp. Virgil, Georgio, i. 495: ‘Exesa inveniet
 scabra robigine pila.¹ Ovid, Epist. ex Pout. i. l. 71 = ¹ Roditur ut scabra posi-
 tum robigine ferrum.’ The metaphor is nearly the same as that in verse 43.

 VIII. These verses are a prefatory letter to Catullus’s translation of a
 poem by Callimaehus, entitled, ‘ De Coma Berenices,’ which he had long
 promised to execute, and send to his friend Hortalus, but which grief for
 the death of his brother had delayed. It is uncertain whether the person
 addressed be Cicero⁹s rival, the famous orator Hortensius, or another
 member of the Hortensian family. The orator, his son, and grandson,
 were called indiﬁ'erently Hortalus and Hortensius. See Cicero, Epist. ad
 Attio. ii. 25; iv. 15; Tacit. Annal. ii. 37 ; Sueton. Tiber. 47. Hortensius
 is agentioned as a writer of verse by Catullus (xcv.) and Ovid (Trist. ii.

 5. Namque mei-The order is: ‘ Namque unda manans Lethaeo gurgite

 7. Rhwtes'o Mom—The Rhmtean headland projected from several
 points of the coast of Mysia or Troas. It is now called Intepela, and the
 town of the same name situated in one of its recesses is Paleo-Castro.
 Ajax Telamon was said to have been buried on a spur of this headland.

 8. Obterit.-¹ Slowly wears sway.’ Comp. Lucret. iii. 916: ‘ Oblrituo
 pondere terraa.’ It is a stronger expression than ‘ ohtegit.’

 l4. Damam-Prome, daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, is called
 Daulias, because she was married to Tereus, king of Daulis, in Phocis.
 (Thucyd. ii. 29; comp. Ovid, Heroid. xv. 154 ; Epist. ad Liviam, v. 105:
 ‘ Deflet Threicium Daulias ales Ityn ¹). According to Ovid (Metamorph.
 vi. 412—476) Procne was changed into a swallow, and her sister Philomela
 into a nightingale; Catullus, however, adopts the legend which converts
 Procne into the *most m'usical most melancholy’ bird. See Milton, ‘ ll
 Penseroso.’ Homer (Odyss. xix.’518) is the original of both Catullus in
 this passage, and Virgil’s more famous (Georg. iv. 4l8) Fate yemens Ityls'.
 Homer, l. c. παῖδ’ ὀλοφυρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον. Itylus, or ltys, was the

  

 CATULLUS. 141

 son of Procne, slain by her snd served up at supper to his father Tereus,
 in revenge for the wrong done to Philomela; hence Itylus is said to be
 ‘ absumptus, mactatus, et comesus.’

 16. Batts'adc.—Battns of Thera was the founder of Cyrene in Lybis.
 The poet Callimachus was a native of that city, and said to be of the
 founder’s kin, being the son of Battus and Mesatme; hence he is called
 by Catullus and Ovid Battiades. Both Propertius and Catullus (see Lives)
 admired and imitated Callimachus.

 Virgil, Eclog. iii. 71 : ι

 ⁶ Aurea mala decem misi: cm altera mitto.’

 19. Ut missum . . . rubore-This simile has every merit, except appro-
 priateness. There is no parity between Catullus and the oiryo ; nor be-
 tween the circumstances of Catullus and her surprise; the connecting
 link is the rubor, or blush, which his delay and her alarm called up.—
 Comeiyae, furtivi muneris, amoris. Conscius is seldom used without the
 object of consciousness annexed. Comp., however, Horace, Carm. i. 2.

 ‘ Conscia cum possit scriptas portare tabellas.’

 IX. This poem records a visit of Catullus to the tomb of his brother in
 the Trend. Roman writers have left us many letters and treatises on
 Consolation, and ancient historians have told many striking tales of pa-
 rental, fraternal, or ﬁlial aﬁection. Yet they rarely express domestic feel-
 ings naturally. The former are full of stately commonplace, the latter are
 either normal or fancied examples. This and the preceding poems of Ca—
 tullus are therefore the more valuable since their pathos is genuine, their
 diction unaﬁ'ected. The following admirable version of these lines, by
 Mr. Theodore Martin, recently published in the Notes to his ‘ Translation
 of the Odes of Horace,’ will be the best comment on them:

 ‘ O’er many a sea, o’er many a stranger land,
 I’ve come, my brother, to thy lonely tomb,
 To pay the last sad tribute to thy doom,
 And by thy silent ashes weeping stand.
 Vainly I call to thee. Who can command
 An answer forth from Orcus’ dreary gloom?
 0h, brother, brother, life lost all its bloom
 When thou wert snatched from me with pitiless hand!
 A day will come, when we shall meet once more!
 Meanwhile, these gifts, which to the honoured grave
 Of those they loved in life, our sires of yore
 With pious hand and reverential gave,
 Accept! gifts moistened with a brother's tears!
 And now, farewell, and rest thee from all fears I’

 X. 3. lure nacratum.-⁴ You will ﬁnd me one of that honourable com-
 pany who respect the laws of silence,’ i. e. perfectly trustworthy.

 4. Hamocratm.—Harpocrates was the last-born son of Osiris, and
 was identiﬁed in his symbols and attributes with the Greek Apollo and
 the Egyptian sun-god Horus. Something mysterious was associated with
 his worship. He was represented with his ﬁnger laid on his lips, indica-
 tive of secrecy. See Ovid, Metamorph. ix. 692: ‘Quique premit vocem
 digitoque silentio suadet.’ The worship of Horus—Harpocrates——was
 sometimes prohibited, but always revived after awhile at Rome. See
 Catullus, lxxiv. 4.

 XI. There can be no doubt that the passion of Catullus for Lesbia, or
 Hostia, was a genuine one, therein standing in strong contrast to the
 shadowy and ideal loves of Horace and ’l‘ibullus. She was false to him,
 and he could not esteem her; yet she retained a hold on his aﬁ'ections,
 and his verses betray the varying emotions of a heart wrung by alternate
 ’llr‘opedand ῗὲεριίτ. This poem also has been exquisitely rendered by Mr.

 heo ore artin:

 ‘ Oh. my soul’s joy, and dost thou wish, as now,
 That evennore our love burn strong and clear?
 Ye gods, grant she be faithful to her vow,
 And that ’tis uttered from a heart sincere!

 ‘ So may each year that hurries o'er us ﬁnd,
 While others change with life's still changing hue,
 The ties that bind us now more ﬁrmly twined,
 Our hearts as fond, our love as warm and true.’

 XII. The Atys (Attis or Atthis) of Catullus is not the Atys of mytho-
 logy. The latter was s Phrygian shepherd of Celmnis, a town of Phrygia,
 beloved by Cybele and slain on her account: the former is her thrall, the
 victim of his own frenzy. lt is necessary to keep this distinction in
 mind, since, if the persons be confounded, the author of the ‘Atys' may
 be taxed with inconsistencies of which he is not guilty. For example,
 why should Atys. if a native of Phrygis, come over the seas—‘ super alts
 vectus maria’—to the Phrygian abode of the goddess? Why, if he were her
 lover or husband, is a lion sent to bar his escape from her temple? The

 css-uuus. 143

 Atys of the poem is therefore properly the Attid novice, or Gallus, a
 priest of the great goddess. The mythological legend, in its triple form,
 is recounted in Smith’s Diet. of Gr. and Rom. Biog. and Mythology,
 a. 1:. It is partly astronomical, partly ethical, and, according to the em-
 peror Julian and the philosopher Porphyry, who each commented upon or
 paraphrased it, typiﬁes the course of the sun in the tropics, or the seve-
 rance of the human soul from vice and error.

 The name of the goddess is probably derived from the cymbals—
 κύμβος, ethane—used in her worship. In works of art, Cybele (Cy-
 belle. Cybebe) is represented as a grave and majestic matron, like Hera
 or Demeter. Sometimes she is veiled, and seated on a throne with lions
 at her side; sometimes riding in a chariot drawn by lions. Her head is
 crowned with towers, whence Milton terms “ the towered Cybele, mother
 of a hundred gods ” (Arcades, v. 21). Her right-hand bears a sceptre,
 and frequently a drum or tsbor. Her worship, like that of Bacchus, was
 orgiastic, accompanied with loud music of ﬂutes. cymbals, drums, etc.,
 songs und dancing. Her priests, named Galli, and Corybantes, rushed
 about with hideous outcries, and cut themselves with knives like the
 priests of Baal (1 Kings, xviii. 28). The box-tree and the cypress were
 sacred to her; from the former were made her pipes, into the latter
 was transformed her lover Atys. A description of the Galli and their
 ceremonies may be read in Apuleius, Metamorph. viii. The principal seats
 of the worship of Cybele were Dindymum, a mountain near Cyzicus, in
 Mysia, whence the goddess is called Dindymene; Berecyntus, in Phrygia;
 (Pliny, N. H. v. 29, mentions a ‘ Berecyntius tractus¹ abounding in box-
 wood, in Chr-im) and Sipylus in Lydia. The temples of Cybele were always
 in elevated places: several aerolites preserved in the temples of Asiatic
 Greece claimed to be original emblems of her sent down from heaven,
 and there was a celebrated chryselephantine statue of the ‘ Mater Dindy-
 mene’ at Proconnesus ; but the face, instead of being formed of plates of
 ivory, was made of the teeth of the hippopotamus (Pausan. viii. 46, § 4).
 Joseph Warton, in his ‘ Essay on Pope,’ makes the following remarks on
 the Atys :—-‘ The whole poem being of a strain superior to the gene-
 rality of Roman poetry, and being also so much above the tender and
 elegant genius of Catullus, whose name it bears, inclines me to think it a
 translation from some Grecian writer: and perhaps it will give the truest
 notion of an old dithyrambic of any poem antiquity has left us.’ The
 dithyramb was sung by a band of revellers to a ﬂute accompaniment. A
 full account of its origin and nature will be found in Donaldson’s New
 Cratylus, g 317, 2nd ed.

 The following spirited version of a portion of the Atys by Mr. Theodore
 Martin, printed among the notes to his‘recently published translation
 of the Odes of Horace, conveys a competent idea of the vigour and bril-
 liancy of the original, in which, as Mr. Dunlop says (Hist. of Rom. Lit.
 vol. i. p. 459), ‘Catullus is no longer the light, agreeable poet, who
 counted the kisses of his mistress, and called on the Cupids to lament her
 sparrow. His ideas are full of ﬁre, and his language of wildness: he
 pours forth his thoughts with an energy, rapidity, and enthusiasm, so
 diﬁ'erent from his usual tone, and indeed from that of all Latin poets.’

 a religious enthusiasm. The earlier Latin poets, however. exercised libe-
 rally their privilege of compounding or inventing epithets: e. g. Pacuvius

 calls the seals and dolphins that followed the sea-god Nereus, ‘ repandi-
 rostrum incurvicervicum pecus.’ Nor did post-Augustam poets forego it :

 in battle. Be it mine to enjoy competence and repose.’ This was the com-
 mon and the natural wish of the Roman poets who wrote amid the con-
 fusion and alarms of civil wars, and had all suffered more or less from the
 proscriptioni in n.c. 43. Compare Eleg. iii. 3. ll :

 ‘ Nam grave quid prodest pondus mihi divitis auri
 ’ Arvaque si ﬁndant pinguia mille greges.’

 In Ovid, who lived in happier days, these moderate wishes disappear.

 rarely intimidated by the approach of an enemy. The meaning may be:
 ‘And who may be afraid to continue in the neighbourhood of a foe his
 usual toil.’ Compare Ovid, Epist. ex Pout. 9. 82: ‘Et quam vicino
 terrear hoste, rugs.’—Cla.m'ca palm is also an unusual phrase, since the
 trumpet is ‘ blown,’ not ‘beaten,’ like ‘ tympana pulsa.’ None of the pro-
 posed emendations throw much light on the passage. Classicum is pro-
 perly an adjective agreeing with signum understood—the signal given by
 sounding a horn to the Classici, or citizens of the Classis Prima in the
 Comitia Centuriata. See Varro, L. L. v. 16, § 27: ‘Tubicines a tuba

 ut tum cum classes comitiis ad comitatum vocant.’

 under the generic name of Hermes, represented the rural deities Silvanus,
 Pan, Vertumnus, Priapus, or even Mercury and Bacchus. They often
 marked the boundaries of land (Dii termini, terminales) or the meeting of
 roads. On the feriae, or holidays of the Roman calendar, they were crowned
 with flowers and freshened with oil. See Apuleius, Florid., proaem, who

 certain stages of the procession libations of milk, honey, and wine, and
 praying for her presence and favour. See Virgil, Georg. i. 338. In
 Eclog. v. 83, this ceremony is termed “Lustretio.” It was probably of
 Pelasgian origin, since the Mantineam of Arcadia seem from Polybius
 (iv. 21, § 9) to have practised similar rites.

 (2.) The Palilia, though it became the festival held on the birth-day of
 the city of Rome (April 2), 5.0. 750) was also a very old Italian holiday.
 It partook more of the character of s Lucis-atio than the Ambarvalia, ﬁre
 and water being employed in it to purify the shepherds, their ﬂocks, herds,
 and farm buildings. The shepherds oﬂ'ered prayers to Pales, accom-
 panied with cakes, millet, milk, etc. After the solemn Lustratio, at even-
 tide bonﬁres were made, through the smoke of which the herds were
 again driven, and the people ran. and the day ended with feasting, and the
 music of ﬂutes and cymbals. (See Ovid, Fast. iv. 731; Propert. Eleg. iv.
 1. 20, and the art. ‘ Palilia’ in Smith’s Diet. of Antiquities.)

 urn (eitella) ﬁlled with water, whence they were drawn forth, or sometimes
 thrown like dice. The questions to be answered, or the name of the ques-
 tioner, was written upon them. Those who foretold future events in this
 way were called Sortilegi. (Lucan, ix. 581.) “Sortilegis egeant dubii

 That the Jews at this time, and even earlier, were very numerous in Rome
 we learn from Cicero’s speech Pro Flacco, § 28: ‘ Multitudinem J udaeorum
 ﬂagrantem nonnunquam in concionibus ;’ and according to Philo (Le at.
 ad Caium, p. 1014), they occupied whole districts of the city: τὴν π ραν
 τοῦ Τιβέρεως ποταμοῦ μεγάλην τῆς Ῥώμης ἀποτομὴν . . . κατεχομένην καὶ

 pomcerium,‘ within the city, but connived at it in the suburbs. It appears
 from J uvenal (Satir. vi. 526) that the goddess exacted from her devotees,
 principally of the female sex, no slight exertions:

 Delia was a devout person at times und the inﬂuence of foreign religions

 28. Picta tabellae-Personas who had escaped from shipwreck, suspended,
 as a token of their gratitude, pictures representing their wreck, and the
 clothes they escaped in, on the walls of Neptune’s or some other sea-god’s

 Isis was worshipped in Greece as Πελαγία, the sea-goddes emphatically.
 It was with reference to this practice of suspending pictures (tabellae)

 met with a tablet of one who was drowned. Comp. Diogen. Laert. vi. 59,

 from the shock of sudden cold. Quintus Curtius (De Exp. Alex. M. iii.

 that every man had his Genius, and every woman her'Juno; that is, a
 spirit who had given them being, and was regarded as their protector
 through life. On their birthdays men made offerings to their Genius, and
 women to their Juno. The oﬂ’erings to the Genius were wine, ﬂowers

 paved with stone a portion of the road. It was apparently a solid work,

 daries was substituted. See Herbert’s ‘ Country Parson.’ The name of
 the festival was derived from the victim offered on the occasion, hostia
 amber-pals}. It was led thrice round the ﬁeld before the ﬁrst sheaf of
 corn was reaped, or the ﬁrst bunch of grapes was cut. 'In its train fol-
 lowed the reepers, vine-pruners, and farm-servants, dancing, and singing
 praises to Ceres or Bacchus. Milk, honey, and wine were the ordinary
 libations. See Virg. Georg. i. 338. -

 cause that the popular meetings were frequently called beneath the
 shade of ancient trees, the objects both of worship and veneration. The
 oak of Guernica, yet ﬂourishing in verdant age, saw the states of Biscay
 assemble under its branches for more than a thousand years, and very

 cover ‘ purpurea toga’—or with the yellow of the woad, lutum (lutea);
 from the sap of cedrus, properly oxy-cedrus, or the juniper, was also
 extracted a yellow stain for book-covers (Ovid, Trist. iii. 1. 13: ‘ Quod

 sort, originally the best, was called ‘hieratica,’ because it was once ap-
 propriated to religious books (Sharpe¹s Hist. of Egypt, ch. xi. p. 375,

 written on a strip of papyrus in bright red letters, and gummed on the
 cover, or sometimes, as is seen in the paintings at Herculaneum, was sus-
 pended from it by strings, as seals were formerly attached to indentures

 i. ¹ Nor am I ashamed to confess that there has sprung up in me weari-
 ness of a life marked by so many misfortunes.’

 9. Umbram.—The Romans, in the time of Tibullus, held very faint con-
 victions of the existence of the soul, when dismissed from the body. The
 earthly corpse they believed to be destroyed by the funeral ﬁre, yet they
 fancied a continued bodily existence in another world. Dr. Donaldson
 (Varronianus, p. 304) remarks, ‘ The practical tendency of the Roman
 mind made them regard all ‘realities as necessarily palpable.’ Homer ,
 (Iliad, xxiii. 108) thus ex resses the uncertainty on the subject of spirits
 which was common to hot, Greeks and Romans:

 ’n πότοι, ἦ pd *ris ἐστὶ καὶ εῖν Ἀΐδαο δόμοισι

 explain the allusions in these verses :——‘ When the pile was burnt down,
 the ﬁre was extinguished, and the embers soaked with wine (annoso
 Lycra, l9); the bones were gathered by the nearest relations, in loose
 robes, and sometimes with bare feet. The bones and ashes, besprinkled
 with the richest perfumes, and wrapped in dry linen (carbaseis velis) were
 then put into the vessel called um. made of earth, brass, marble,silver,
 or gold, according to the rank of the deceased; and this was solemnly
 deposited in the sepulchre-whence ‘componere’ (componi, 26) signiﬁes
 to bury, to shut up, to end. On the monument was inscribed the name
 of the, person interred, his character, and sometimes the cause of his
 death. _

 28. Celebri ﬂoater—On a tablet visible to posters-by; whence the

 usual address of ‘ Siste Viator.’

 30. Causa perire, a Gmcism = cause pereundi.—Lyydamur. In this
 word there may be an allusion to the Gentile name of Tibullus, viz.
 Albius, the white. Lygdos is a white stone. ‘Lygdinus lspis . . . candoris
 esimii’ (Plin. N. H. xxxvi. 8, 5 13).

 Ease. X. This elegy. is also addressed to Neaera during absence. .

 4. Domo answers to the French Mm, the abode of a rich or noble
 family. Cstull. lxi. 156: ‘ En tibi domus ut potens, et beata viri tui.‘

 9. Premenue.—‘ Portioned out at my birth by the Fates.’

 10. Nudus . . . rate.——See Proper. iv. 5. l3:

 ‘ Hand ullus portabis opes Acherontis ad undas:
 N udus ab inferna, stulte, vehere rate.’

 l3. Phrygiic . . . Taenare . . . Carysle.—Synuads, a town of Phrygia
 Salutaris, was celebrated for a beautiful kind of marble, furnished by the
 neighbouring quarries of Docimia (Doeimites lapis). The marble was of
 a light colour, variegated with purple spots or veins (Plin. N. H. xxxv. 1).
 Taenarum, now Cape Matapan, was the southernmost point of Laconia
 and Europe. The marble from its quarries is described by Pliny (N. H.
 xxxvi. 18, 5 29) as black, though others (my. Sextus Empiricus, i. 30)
 say it was yellow in the mass. white when broken to pieces. The Carys-
 tian marble came from Carystus, ι town in the island of Euboea. It was
 in much request at Rome. It was a green stone with white circles, the
 modern es'poh'na.

 15. Et nemora . . . Juana—Shrubs and small trees were often planted
 round the impluvium, or unroofed court in front of a Roman house. See
 Horace, Carm. iii. 10. 5: ‘ Nemus. inter pulchra satum tecta;’ and Epist. i.
 10. 22; ‘Inter varies nutritur silva columnas ;’ and also around the peri-
 stylium, an open space at the back of it, surrounded by colonnades.

 29. Lydius amnia-The river Pactolus, which in ancient times, though
 not in the age of Tibullus, carried in its ooze considerable portions of
 gold-dust, whence it was called Chrysorrhoas. Soph. Philoct. 393: Τὸν

 88. Diceae-Orcus, or Pluto, is denominated rich because all the rich
 men of the earth become his victims.—Ignaea, sluggish, stagnant.

 Ease. XI. This elegy is addressed to some friends of Tibullus who
 had gone to the baths of Etruris, while he was detained at home by a
 fever.

 l. Etruscis fontibus mutim-The baths and mineral springs of Etruria,
 both hot and cold, were numerous and much frequented by the Romans.
 Dionysius Halic. (i. 37) thus describes their medicinal virtues: Ἔχει
 δὲ ἦ γῆ καὶ νάματα θερμῶν ὑδάτων ἐν πολλοῖς εὑρημένα χωρίοις λουτρὰ
 παρασχεῖν ἥδιστα καὶ νόσους ἰάσασθαι χρονίους ἄριστα. Comp. Strab. v.
 p. 347. Among the more celebrated of these watering-places were the
 Aqua Cmretanm; Clusinae, cold springs (Horace, Epist. i. 15. 8); Pisnnm;
 Tauriaua: (Rutilius. Itiner. i. 250).

 2. Estioum Canem.-—The Dog-star rises on the 22nd of May, from
 which period until the autumn the Etruscan baths were reputed unwhole-
 some. Antonius Muss, the celebrated physician of Augustus. seems to
 have considered Baiae as unhealthy, and to have sent his patients to the
 cold baths of Etruria (τὰ Ἄλβουλα, Strab. v. 3) in preference. About
 the time when Tibullus was writing, Marcellus, the nephew and sou-in-
 law of Augustus, died at Beim (Dion, liii. 30), and the place became for a
 time unpopular. Martial (Epig. iv. 57. 5) says that it was unendurahle
 during the summer. ‘Maxima Baiarurn’ is obscure, probably corrupt.
 The construction seems to be: ‘ unda maxima Baiarum vos detinet.’—
 Lymphis fueris. Each stream and fountain had its tutelary deity.·-Lau-
 dando . . . Dm. The Bonn Dea of the Romans, whose rites it was for-
 bidden men to behold. The 1st of May was her festival, and the anni·

 the Chief Pontiff, and it was accounted most sacrilegious in Clodius to
 have intruded himself upon her mysteries (Plutarch, Caesar, c. 9).

 l2. Nec facta nudanda, no secret crimes.—Solh'cilant. Sollicitum red-
 dunt cor meum.—L¢sere. ' Changed the colour of,’ as winter changes the
 colour of foliage. Ovid, iii. Art. Am. 204 :

 ¹ Pallescuut frondes, quas nova laesit hyems.’

 Tibullus alleges a double plea against a sentence of death (ι Persephone
 nigram denuntiat horam,’ v. 5): ‘ I have been no murderer,nor blasphemer
 of the gods. . . . Neither am I so advanced in years as to render death’s
 approach a natural event. My hair is yet dark, my step ﬁrm. I was
 born in such a year, n.c. 43, when Hirtius and Pansa, the consuls, fell
 before the walls of Mutina. Why pluck the unripe grape, or rob the tree
 of its crude fruit with injurious hand? It will be time by-aud-by to
 behold the Elysian Fields,’ etc-Referam pueris. Comp. Eleg. i. 10. 44:

 32. Paine—The ancients avoided naming death, as a word ot ill omen:
 hence, when Cicero announced to the people that the confederates of
 Catiline were dead, he used the term ‘vixerunt,’ *they have ceased to
 liveil-ENig-rae pecudeo. Black cattle were the proper victima to the under-
 eart cities.

 ’7 Euo. I. From verse 7 of the next Elegy it appears that the Galina

 who is here supposed to address a ﬂying comrade, was a kinsman (propin-
 qui) of Propertius.

 l. Commie»: . . . cmm.—‘ Alot aimilarto mine,’ viz. death at the hand
 of a pursuer or a bandit.

 2. Etruscis . . . oygeribus.—'l‘he walls of Perusia (Perugia), where
 Lucius Antonius defended himself against the three armies of Octavius,
 Agrippa, and Salvidienus, in 13.0. 41. Famine, so severe as to be comme-
 morated long after as the ‘Perusina fames,’ compelled Antonius to sur-
 render. But though his own life, and the lives of the principal Roman
 nobles on his side were spared, the town itself was given up to plunder,
 its principal citizens were put to death, and ﬁnally Perusia itself, by acci-
 dental conﬂagration, was burnt down, n.c. 40. It was restored and re-
 peopled by Augustus, and became again, by virtue of its strong position,
 and of its convenience as the border town between Umbria and Etruria,
 an important place, as numerous inscriptions attest. The modern Perugia
 contains 15,000 inhabitants, and is the capital of a province of the Roman
 States. Gallus had been one of the garrison during the siege, and may
 have escaped when L. Antonius attempted unsuccessfully to break through
 the Roman lines.

 3. Quid . . . torquem-Quid torques lumina turgentia (ﬂetu, lacrymis)
 ad nostrum gemitum.

 4. Pars ego . . . milih'a.—‘ Late 1 was your comrade.’

 _ my sister learn my fate (acta) from your tears ;’ implying, ‘ My parents
 will never welcome me again: my sister, if you escape not, will never
 know how and where I fell.’

 7. Per medias = inter medios.—Propertius uses per for inter in, among
 others. the following passages. Eleg. iv. l. 4:

 ‘ Itala per Graios orgia ferre chorol.‘

 ‘ terra Etrusca,’ where the bones of my kinsman Gallus are bleached in

 9. Umbria-A very large portion of Umbria is mountainous; whence
 it is called by Martial, Epig. iv. 10, ‘ montana Umbria5' but on the west
 the highlands terminate abruptly on the edge of u broad plain, which ex-
 tends from the neighbourhood of Spoleto to Perugia: hence Propertius
 writes, *Proxima contingens Umbria campo,’ hills abutting on the chum-
 paign (Wo) beneath it. The birthplace of Propertius was probably
 Asinium (Auiti) in the vicinity of the Clitnmnus and Mevania. Many of
 the Umhrian, as well as the Etruscan towns, were built on rocky emi-

 Of purple Apennine.’

 Uben‘bus.—‘ Well irrigated by streams ﬂowing down from the hills.’
 The name of Umhria is sometimes derived from ὄμβροι, a land well
 watered and liable to rain; and Mevania, in the neighbourhood of Pro-
 pertius)’s birth-place, was called the moist Mevanis, ‘ nebulosa’ (Eleg. iv.

 Eua. Ill. Macenas appears to have been urging Propertius to treat of 7η l
 some higher theme than Love. He pleads inability to deal with wars of
 gods or men, old or recent, and says (v. 44) that every poet should keep
 to the path marked out for him by his proper temperament or genius.

 2. Mollie . . . üben—A poem of gentle mood, s“. e. on Love—In ora. To
 the lips and tongues of men; like ‘ virum volitare per ora,’ Georg. 9.

 3. Calliope, the muse of Epic poetry.—Caulat, ‘ dictates.’

 5. Siva—Supply ‘vidi’ from v. 7.—Coiu . . . coccie. From the silk
 produced by the looms of Cos, an island in the Myrtosn sea, were woven
 the tight transparent dresses called Coca vester, and which are mentioned
 by nearly all the Augustan poets. They were often dyed with the ﬁne
 purple, also a product of the island, and adorned with stripes of gold
 tissue. Caccie, from mecum. is a dye extracted from an insect that breeds
 on the Querens meq‘fera, or Kermes oak, and it rivalled in the brilliaucy
 of its tints the Tyrian scarlet, which was derived from the Murex and
 Helia* ianthina. Martial (Epig. iv. 28) combines both Conn and Tyrian
 dyes. in this passage cocci: is the stolen dyed with coccum. Propertius
 frequently refers to his mistress’s splendid appearance (ﬂlgenlem) in this
 dress; 0. p. i. 2. 2; ii. 3. 15, etc. etc,

 10. Faciles.—Pliant, skilful.

 12. Causam-Sc. canendi.

 15. Tantum-Sc. ingenium. ‘ Had fortune assigned me so high a vein
 of verse that I could “ sing of old great houses and fights fought long

 tales of Thebes and Troy, but I should have sung of Caesar’s exploits and
 your share in them, O Mammal—Herons mam, bands ot* heroes. Sc.
 copiss heroum.

 18. Imposition—Agrees with ‘montem,’ implied in ‘Ossam.’ Ossa,
 Olympus, and Pelion, are usually combined in passages alluding to the
 wars of the Titans with the gods: 9. y. Ovid, Fast. i. 307: ‘ Sic petitur
 ccelum non ut ferat Ossan Olympus.v ⁴ Summaque Peliacus sidera tangat
 sper,’ iii. 441. Comp. Virgil, Georg. i. 280; Odyss. xi. 314. The geo-
 graphical relation of these mountains was-Ossa is separated from Olym-
 pus by the vale of Tempe, and Pelion rises to the south of Osss. Ossa is
 conical in form, and has only one summit; Olympus has a broad summit
 and precipitous sides and spurs. Pelion has an extended ridge, and two
 summits with a hollow space between them, so as to give it in some
 respects the appearance of a saddle-backed mountain.

 l9. Nomen Homen’.—Whence‚ ἑο. from the war of Troy, Πέῃαμα Τροίης,
 Homer derived his fame—Bind vada. The sea on either side of Mount
 Athos, which Xerxes joined by cutting a canal through its base. Herod.
 vii. 2l.

 22. Cimbrorum . . . Mart—The Cimbri invaded Italy in 5.0. 101, und
 were defeated by Marius at Vercellae in the summer of that yeah—Bene-
 facta. Perhaps in this word is implied a contrast between the services of
 Marius as a soldier, and the mischief he did as a politician, to the com-
 monwealth. By his victories over the Cimbri and Teutones he rolled back
 for 1threie centuries the tide of northern immigration from Italy and the
 civi ize world.

 25. Madman—By breaking up the siege of Mutinay Octavius rescued
 Decimus Brutus and the republican party from M. Antonius, und then by ,
 joining his forces to those of the Caesar-inns, Lepidus, Antonius, etc., he
 crushed the faction of Brutus and Cassius.-—~Civilia busta. Philippi, where
 so many of the noblest citizens of Rome were slain and buried. So *pa-

 three-quarters of a mile long, called the Heptastadium, of which the
 light-house formed the northern extremity.— Tractus in urbem. An image
 of the Nile in chains seems to have been carried before the triumphal car

 Triumphalia to the Capitol. The name Sacra was, however, derived from
 the religious purposes to which the Via was applied. By it the augura
 descended from the arx, when, aﬂer observing the heavens, they proceeded
 to inaugurate anything in the city below. Up this road also sacrifices
 were borne to the arm-Aetia rostra. The beaks of the ships destroyed
 in the battle of Actium, or, more probably, representations of them, were
 carried (currere) at the triumph of Augustus.—Caput. ⁴ Faithful stay and
 prop of the state in peace or war.’ ‘ Caput' ( pars pro toto) is a man, a
 person,even an animal. Horace, Carin. i. 24. l: ⁸ Quis desiderio sit pudor

 a compliment to the illustrious friends Augustus and Meccnas.

 one of the surgeons who accompanied the Greeks to Troy.— Charon, wisest

 in medicine among them.— Dear Epidaurius. Esculapius. The restoration
 of Androgeus, son of Minos, is mentioned by Propertius alone. Eschylus
 (Again. 990) says that he revived Hippolytus, with whom Ovid, Fast. vi.

 3.0. 239. His great historical poem was called “ Annalee.”—-Curioo, for
 Curiatios.—Homtia pila. “ The word Hor-atius is derived from the old
 Latin word, hir, a hang, and is therefore a longer form of Hir-tius, just
 as Curiatius is of Cur-tius. The ﬁght between the Horatii and Curatii
 probably refers to a contest between the Cüriätii (κούρητες), ‘ men of the
 curia, and wielders of the spear, or wearers of the helmet,’ and the Hö-
 titii (χερνῆτες), “ handicraftsmen,’ i. e. the lower order, in which contest,
 as usual, the latter succeeded in maintaining their just rights’ (Donald-

 Enna. VII. The poems in which Propertius treated of the early history k J
 of Rome, though placed last in his collected writings, were probably t
 among his earlier compositions. The language, though often very beautiful
 and always vigorous, is less correct and polished than that of the Elegies
 addressed to Cynthia. The versiﬁcation, also, is less harmonious, and the
 employment of long words at the close of the pentameters is more agree-
 able to Greek than to Roman usage, and indicates that the youthful poet
 still ‘felt himself in bondage to his Alexandriam models. Callimachus
 wrote a poem in four books called Αἵτιει, or the causes of various mythical
 stories, religious ceremonies, and ancient customs. This may have been
 the pattern of Propertius in the following poems. His design of putting
 into verse the principal heroes and events commemorated in the Roman
 calendar was more fully executed by Ovid in his Fasti.

 l. Qua maxima Roma est—Comp. Ovid, Fast. 71:

 ‘ Jam modo qua fuerant silvie pecorumque recessus
 Urbs erat.’

 Perhaps Varro furnished the original form to both poets:

 ‘ ubi inmc est Roma: montium demissior
 n mus ocus.

 3. Navali . . . Phebe—Augustus, among many other monuments of his p
 victory over Antonius and Cleopatra at Actium, 3.0. 31, built in theg
 Roman forum a temple to Apollo, the front of which was decorated with,‘
 the prows of the Egyptian galleys, his prizes. Comp. Ovid, Art. Amatu

 ‘These temples, now glittering with gold, and adorned with marble, in

 with boughs to shelter gods of clay.’ So Ovid, Fast. i. 203: ‘ Frondibus
 ornabant qua: nunc capitolia gemmis.’—C'¢ua, the shrine; ‘ case Romuli'
 (Plutarch, Romul. 20). ‘Casa’ is again used for ‘sacellum,’ v. 9. 28.—
 Tarpeiusque pater. Once merely the tuteiary deity of the Tarpeian Hill,
 afterwards Jupiter Capitolinus (/Eneid, viii. 347; Ovid, Fast. i. 201).—
 Nuda de rupe. The hill, as yet unbuilt upon.

 8. Tiber-1's advenam-The visiting (‘adveniens’) river. The epithet is
 given to the Tiber by Ovid, Fast. ii. 68; 524; to the Nile, ib. v. 268 ;
 to the Ocean, by Valerius Flaccus, Argon. i. 688. A river, ⁴ wandering at
 its own sweet will,’ advances to or recedes from places on its banks, like
 a traveller or a guest coming and departing—Bum. Herds of cattle
 alone were there to greet the ‘Tiber adveniens.v The spot here alluded
 to is the Ox-market of Rome, Forum Boarium. It stood on the site of
 the old Velabrum, in a swamp between the Tiber and the Palatine Hill.

 21. Coronam mute—Comp. Ovid, Fast. vi. 311. It was usual, on
 festivals and holidays, to put garlands on such animals as either shared in
 them by cessation from labour, or were sacred to the deity to whom the
 day was sacred. At the Vestalia, the mills rested, and the mill-stones
 were hung with garlands, and the asses who carried the grain and ﬂour
 were crowned, and bread was suspended from their necks—Compile =
 the Compitalia, or annual festival of. the Lares Compitales, celebrated on
 the 3rd of January. The exact form of the annual proclamation of them
 is preserved by Macrobius, Saturn. i. 4; und Gellius, Noct. Att. x. 24.—
 Ad calamon. Merely with a pipe of reeds—Syrian; The tuba of the sacri-
 ﬁcer was adopted from Etruria at a later date. See Virgil, Georg. ii. 193 :
 ‘Inﬂavit cum pinguis ebur Tyrrhenus ad MAI-Verbera octova. Stripes
 inﬂicted by the Luperci with gostskiu thongs. See Ovid, Fast. v. 102.
 ——Unde='ex qno.’—Licem=petuluns‚ ‘ sportive.’ The Luperci indulged in
 very coarse pleasantries at the Lupercalia. They were divided into two
 hands; the followers of Romulus being called Quintilii, those of Remus,
 Fabii. See Ovid, Fast. iii. 377 folL—Nuda prmlia. ‘Praelia sine justis
 armis,’ as in Eneid, vii. 524 : ‘Stipitibus duris agitur sudibusque prxeustis.’
 (Tegula-itus. Wearing the 94km, or cup made of wolf-skin (Eneid,

 noun-nus. I77

 ⁸ Fnlvosque lupi de pelle galeros
 Tegmen habent capiti.’

 A wolf-skin cap was a shepherd's trophy, and Lucmo, it is insinuated by
 his helmet, was only I shepherd king, whose chief duty it was to settle
 disputes among shepherds.

 31. Titian, Ramses, [menu—The three original tribes of Rome. The
 Titienses, or Quirites, were Ssbines; the Ramnes, Oscan or Latin; the
 Luceres, Pelugim.—Emc, ex primordiis tam In those
 days so inconsidenble s place was Rome, that even Bovillss was the
 larger city. Bovilhe was ten miles distant from Rome ς yet, as the Appian
 and other roads were lined with houses, parks, tombs, etc., the suburbs of
 the capital extended for many miles in all directions. ⁴ Suburban,’ indeed,
 seems a conventional adjunct to Bovilhe. Ovid (Fast. iii. 667) also em-
 ploys it: *Orta suburbanis quaedam fuit Anna Bovillis.’ ‘Suburbanus,’
 however, does not mean ‘ close to a city’ in all cases, since Horace calls
 his Sabine farm ‘ suburbana rura,’ and it was nearly twenty-ﬁve miles
 from Rome.—Mlpaln'um, nisi nomen. ‘Of original Rome little or nothing
 but the name is left, but of that name the wolf-cubs are not ashamed.’
 In the Social War, Pontius of Telesia, the Samnite commander, urged his
 countrymen to destroy Rome, saying that it would never be well with
 Italy until the wolves were burnt in their lair. Lord Macaulay, in the
 ferplphecy of Capys,’ 5 17, has ﬁnely expressed the pride of the Romans
 in en· nurse:

 ‘ But thy nurse will bear no master,
 Thy nurse will bear no load,
 And woe to them that shear her,
 And woe to them that goadl
 When all the pack, loud baying,

 Her bloody lair surrounds.
 She dies in silence, biting hard,
 Amidst the dying hounds.’

 41. Jam bene »pandebant-Mn Paley observes, an the shortening a
 vowel before et, ep, etc., that, “ though avoided by the most polished Latin
 poets, it has a precedent in Homer’s use of Σκάμανδρος, σκεπαρνόν, etc.
 The analogy of the French e’pine (Lat. spina) makes it probable that in
 such cases as ‘ bene spondebant,’ ‘ cape spinosi’ (v. 4. 48), etc.,the sibilant
 was dropped in pronunciation. So in ‘ Consuluitque striges’ (ib. 5. 17),
 and in ‘ smaragdos’ (iii. 7. 44), where ’lriges (τρίζειν, ‘ to screech ’)
 and ’maragdos were pronounced. Comp. σμύρνη with μύρρα, σμύραινα
 with μύραινα, σμικρὸς with μικρός. The objection on the part of the best
 Latin poets was, therefore, properly speaking, to the mutilated pronuncia-
 tion, just as to the dropping of the ﬁnal I with Ennius and Lucretius, as
 in navibu’ pandis, vivu’ per era." In a note at p. 58—62 of Dr. Simmons’s
 ‘ Life of Milton,’ the question of shortening or lengthening a vowel before
 ep, st, is examined at considerable length. He cites from Propertius
 (iv. ll. 53), ‘ brachia spectavi;’ but Mr. Paley thinks that ‘ brachia' may
 have been read as s dissyllable.

 46. Portam, sc. Venue—Annuals). The residence of the Sibyl was at
 Cumin, near the lake Avernum-eortina, in its ﬁrst sense, is a kettle, ' vas
 rotundum et concavum ad varios usus.’ Next, ‘quod ejus vasis similitu-

 the responses. Sometimes eortina is the lid (operculum) of the tripod.
 ‘ Non tripodas cortina tegit’ (Prudentius, Apotheos. 506).-Remo. Synony-
 mous, as in other passages, with Romulus: each means ‘ the Ramnian.’—

 57. Disponere.-⁴ Gerbe ordine narrare, describere’ (Kuinoel).

 61. Hirsute—Rough, like a hairy savage.

 ‘ Rude was the age of Ennins, rough his chimes;
 A smoother verse beﬁts these polished times.’

 65. Seandentee . . . arcer are the abrupt precipices on which the birth-
 place of Propertius stood. See note on Eleg. II. 9.
 69. Sacra dicoque comm—Comp. Ovid. Fast. i. 7:

 ⁸ Sacra recognosces annalibus ernta priscis,
 Et quo sit merito quaeque notata dial

 The younger poet’s scheme was indeed the more regular and comprehen-
 sive, since be included Astronomy in his plan, ib. l:

 ‘ Tempora eum causis Latium digesta per annum
 Lapsaque sub terras ortaque signs canam.’

 From verse 70 to the end of this Elegy the poet excuses himself for aban-
 doning his original scheme, which proved too laborious on trial, or too
 uncongenial to his temper. He pretends that an astrologer warned him
 that the proposed historical poem would prove a failure. The star-reader,
 perhaps some critical friend to whom Propertius showed his ﬁrst drafts
 of a Fasti, gave him bad advice, for he had the power, if he lacked the
 industry, necessary for the task. We may imagine the supposed prophet,
 on learning the poet’s intention to treat of ‘sacra diesque et cognomina
 prisca locorum,’ breaking out impatiently—-

 ‘ Art mad, Propertius 3 Empire's futes to sing
 Demands a poet with a stronger wing:
 Such( lofty themes thy genius soar above:
 Remain thou liegeman to the god of Love.’

 75. Certaferam certis auctoribus.—‘ I will prove my prophetic skill by
 authorities you cannot dispute.’

 76. Siqua-The planets, whose movements were exhibited on a kind
 of orrery. See Cicero, Nat. Deor. ii. 34= ‘Quod si in Scythiam aut in

 eﬂ‘ecit Posidonius, cujus singulae conversiones idem eﬂiciuut in sole et in _

 ‘They have turned the gods to gain: for gold they will make Jupiter

 i. 539 : ‘ Obliqnus qua se signorum verteret ordo.’ The Chaldaei, or ma-
 thematicians, exercised a dangerous inﬂuence at Rome, since they often
 encouraged their dupes to engage in political intrigues and conspiracies.
 See Tacitus, Ann. iv. 58; vi. 22; Juvenal, Satin vi. 553. Augustus lis-
 tened to them (Sueton. August. 94). Tiberius kept a band of them at
 Capreae (Juvenal, ib. 94). Ennius (ap. Cicero De Div. i.) thus describes
 the various kinds of fortune-tellers z

 ‘ Non habeo denique nsuci Marsum augurem,
 Non vicanos haruspices, non de circo astrologes,
 Non Isiacos conjectures, non interpretes somniiim.
 Non enim sunt ii gut scientia sat arte divini,
 Sed superstitiosi vstes impudentesque hsrioli:
 Aut inerte· aut insani, ant quibus egestas imperat»
 Qui tibi semitam non sapiunt, alteri monstrant vigmg
 Quibu’ divitias pollicentur, ab iis drachmam ipsi petnnt;
 De his divitiis sibi deducant drachmam, reddunt castera.’

 87. Dicam.——‘ I could tell.’-——Di.n' ego. ‘ For have I not told already
 the fates of Arria’s two sons? I said to her, If they go to the wars, they
 will not return from them. But go they must, said the covetous mother,
 who had an eye to their pay (sﬁpendium); and so Lupercus was crushed
 by his wounded horse, and Gallus the standard-bearer (aquilg'fer) was
 killed at the foot of his own eagle. And there are their tombs to this
 day to testify that I lied not.’

 99. Arenoeum antrum-The oracle of Zeus Ammon, in the great oasis of

 to make love-verses for ever, and not to spout in the law-courts, or to
 compose epics or tragedies.’ The Life of Propertius will explain the allu-
 sions from v. 117 to v. 130.

 131. Fallax φω.-“ Quod in fraudibus et fallaciis versatur’ (Lach.

 Euro. vm. Vertumni.—Vertumnua, we are told by Varro (L. L. v.
 46, p. 18 : Müller), was a chief divinity with those Etruscans who came
 with Galina Vibenna to Rome. ‘ Ab iia dictus Vicus Tuscus, et ideo ibi
 Vertumnum stare quod is dens Etrnrim princeps.’ The word Vertumnum,
 says Dr. Donaldson (Varmnianus, ch. xii. § 5), “ has long been recognized
 as a participial from verto. lt is usual to consider this Etruscan deity
 as the god of the autumn, or of the ripe fruits; but the co-existence of
 the Auctummu shows that this cannot be the correct view of the matter.
 As the husband of Pomona, the summer-goddess, Vertumnus begets
 Ceculwr, the darkening time of the year, and must therefore, in himself,
 he a personiﬁcation of the Spring, ver, which is actually included in his
 name. For ver=ver—t (Ὲ-εαρ-τ) is the period when the germs of the fruits
 ﬁrst come into being, and this, as the beginning of new life, is a change
 from the previous state of decay and non-existence. We may say that
 Vertumnus (or Vertunnus; cf. Neptunus for Neptumnus) is the year when
 ‘it changes itself,‘ or puts on a new dress; and as the aura Favoni, in the
 language of Lucretius, is not only retemta, or released from its former
 bondage in the dungeons of Winter, but also genitaln'h's, or the cause of
 birth, we may see that Vertumnus. the god of change, is also the repre-
 sentaﬁve of the generation or birth of the fruits which lie fecundating
 under the care of Pomona, until they spring up into the Auctumnus =
 Auctomenos, or growing year." Comp. id. ib. ch. 5, § 2.———Signa paterna.
 ¹ The proofs or tokens of my Etruscan original-Inter praelia. In that war
 when Cosles Vibenna came to aid one of the early Roman kings, Tarquinius
 Priscus, according to some writers (Tacit. Ann. iv. 65), Romulus, accord-
 ing to others (Dionys. ii. 36).

 5. Haec me turba junat.-¹ This crowded and noisy street.’ the Vicus
 Tuscus, leading from the Velabrum to the Forum Romanum. A portion
 of this street was called Thnrarius, from the commodities sold in the
 shops. Horace, Epist. i. 269: ‘ Deferar in vicum vendentem thus et
 odores.’ Mr. Paley, ad loq., compares the title ‘ street or quarter of the
 Tuscans’ with the Jewry, or Jews' quarter, in English cities.

 7. Hac.—-—Supply ‘via,’ along the Velabrum. The Velabrum was ori-
 ginally under water deep enough for boats, whence its name, from Vela.
 Comp. Ovid, Fasti, vi. 405—10.—Concem't alumnis. ⁴ The river permitted

 Pliny (Nat. Hist.), cucurbita is a melon, or pumpkin. In the south of
 Europe, gourds form the staple diet of the poorer people. Their mode of
 growth on the ground is described by Virgil, Georg. iv. 121 : ⁴ Tortusque
 per herbam, Cresceret in ventrem cucumis.’ “ The winding of the stalk
 along the ground, and the swelling of the fruit, excellently distinguish
 these plants " (Martin’s note ad loc.).—Brasn'ca vineta. Cabbages and

 tinum reducere studuit [Augustus]. Ac visa quondam pro concione
 pullatorum turbs, indignabundus et clamitans, “En. ‘Romanos, rerum

 61. Mamurium-This Etruscan sculptor, contemporary with Numa, is
 celebrated by Ovid (Fast. 383) as equally remarkable for his worth
 and his skill. He was employed by that king to make copies of the
 ancile which fell from the skies. ‘ Ma-mnrius is an elongated form of
 Magi-s, the male or manly god’ (Varronianus, ch. 5, g 2).

 2. Osca . . . manus.

 ‘ A maple block I was ere Numa ruled,
 A hasty sculptor me most rudely tooled.
 Poor as I was, I pleased a simple race: ›
 Then Mamur eased the block in shining brass;
 For which good service and his skilful hand,
 Lie light upon his bones, old Oscan land!
 Simple the work, yet manifold the praise
 Due to that artist, famed in ancient days.’

 Eum. lX. The legend of Tarpeia who betrayed the Capitol to the Ssbines
 is still extant among the populace of Rome. She is believed to be now sit-
 ting in a hollow of the Capitoline Hill, covered with gold and jewels, but
 visible only at intervals. She goes by the name of La Bella ’ru-peis
 (Niebuhr’s Hist. Rome. i. p. 230, E.T. 3rd ed.). The Tarpeias» Rock is
 supposed to owe its name to her. The legend is treated of by Livy, i. ll,
 Dionys. Hah’e. ii. 38-40, and alluded to by Ovid, Fast. i. 260. Varro (L. L.
 v. 41) speaks of Tarpeia as a Vestal virgin; but Plutarch (Numa, 10)
 places her after Romulus, among the {our original Vestals appointed by
 Numa. .

 2. Limina capta, taken by the Sabines.—Lucasfeliw, i.e. sacen-Hede-
 mm;I concitus antro. A grove running down the sides of a hollow covered

 9. Rum (hareth-A trumpeter of Quirium, a Sabine town on the
 Quirinal hill, at war with the Ramnes, or Romans, on the Palatine. .

 l3. Curia septa-The pen-fold or enclosure of the wards (cur-ice) of
 Rome, (nunc.) afterwards the Curis Hostilia, where, during the times of
 the Commonwealth, the meetings of the ‚Senate were ordinarily held.
 It stood above the Rostra, and a ﬂight of stairs led up to it from the Foo
 rum. It was said to have been originally built by Tullus Hostilius (Varro
 L. L. iv. 32).--Fonte. A pool or spring, halfway down the plivus Capito-
 linus, from which water was drawn for the service of the temple. It was
 sacred to the Moses, and called *Fons Csmmnarum.’

 28. Comata est omina lama—Comp. Tibull. El. i. 3. l7: ‘ Ant ego sum
 causatus aves aut omina dira.’ “ Omens of the moon,” says Mr. Paley (ad -

 Persius (Sat. ii. 16) = ⁴ Et noctem ﬂumine purgas.’

 27. Primo . . . funum-When the ﬁres are lighted at eventide. Comp.
 Virgil, Eclog. i. 83 : ‘ Et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant,’ where
 Servius says. ‘ Id est, ad vesperum, omne pmparands.’

 28. Rubia—The sides of the hills on which Rome was afterwards built,
 were covered with brushwood, brambles, etc. Comp. Virgil, Eneid, viii.

 347 :
 ‘ Capitolia . . .
 Aurea nunc, olim sylvestribus horrida dumis.⁹

 30. Vulnera, sc. amorim-Non patienda, sc. Tarpeia. A portress, not to
 be endured (because treacherous) by Jupiter in his adjacent shrine. The
 arx, or citadel, stood on the northern and loftier peak, the eac-ellum ,Iovis
 o: Ἔα soilitheriaf. point of the Clivua Capitolinus. The Arx Tarpeia was

 32. Formosa . . . armus-The picta arma of v. 20. The object admired
 by Tarpeia was the painting on the shields, the distinctions or emblems of
 the Sabine chiefs. In the Seven against Thebes, each Argive chieftain
 has his proper cognizance painted on his buckler.

 33. 0 utinam . . . Tati.

 ⁴ Bondage will welcome be, if bound I may
 Still gaze on Tatius and his brave array.’

 34. Additm-Built upon. Comp. Virg. Eneid, 336:
 ‘ Pergamaque, Iliacamque jugis hanc addidit arcem.’

 35. Ille equus . . . jubas.-¹ That horse alone shall hear me (re-ponet

 And Macaulay, ‘ Battle of the Lake Regillus,’ st. 30:

 ⁴ The raven-mane that daily
 With pats and fond caresses,
 The young Herminia washed and combed,
 And twined in even tresses.’

 39. Scylla was the daughter of Nisus, king of Megan, who, smitten
 with love for Minos, king of Crete, cut off the golden hairfrom her father‘s
 head, and thus caused his death and the capture of her country. She is
 therefore aptly compared by Tarpeia to herself, who meditated betraying
 to Tatins the citadel and its governor, her father, Sp. Tarpeius; but in
 v. 40, Candidaque in am, etc.. the poet improperly confounds th
 daughter of Nisus with another Scylla, changed by Circe into a sea
 monster.—Fmtms' monstri. The Minotaur, Ariadne’s half-brother, whoa
 death she caused by furnishing Theseus with the clue (lecto stamine) to
 the labyrinth (torta via). “ The primary sense of legere," says Mr. Paley,
 ad. loc. “is ‘to gather as you go.’ Hence. ‘to read,’ and ‘to speak’
 (λέγειν) is ‘to pick out words,’ on a page or in a speech. ‘ Legere ﬂu-

 ‘ On Vesta's altar if extinct the ﬂame,

 For weeping Sabines, late by Rome betrayed,
 Bear me away a willing Roman maid.’

 59. Commissa» aciem-Tutius made war on Home to revenge the rape
 of the Sabines by Romulum-Solvere. The allusion is to the reconciliation
 of the opposing hosts by the Roman matrone. Liv. i. 13; Ovid, Fast.
 237.-Palla is a wedding-garment, as in Ovid, Heroid. ni. 162 =

 ¹ Et trahitur multo splendida palla croco.’

 And palla mea=nuptiis meis.-—Mediumfwdus. “ And now the ﬁght was
 ﬁerce: than ever: when, on a sudden. the Sabine women, who had been
 carried oﬂ, ran down from the hill Palatinus, and ran in between their
 husbands and their fathers, and prayed them to lay aside their quarrel. So
 they made peace (ﬁedus inibant) with one another, and the two people
 became as one.” (Arnold, Hist. Rome, ch. i.)

 68. Quarta buccina-The guard was changed every three hours, oon-
 sequently the fourth trumpet means the twelfth, ἰ. e. the last hour of the
 ni ht.

 €55. Erperiar mmrmm.—‘ I will try to sleep: the very stars are sinking
 into their ocean-bed.’

 70. Cuqmm alite-Tarpeiis fault, as regarded Vesta, was that she had
 suffered the sacred ﬁre to go out. Vesta avenges herself by adding fuel to

 her passion (comp. Virgil, Eneid iv. 2: ‘ vulnus alit venis'), and kindling
 its ﬂames (faces) afresh. Whence Tarpeia rushes forth like a nymph of
 Thrace, a Bacchante, with torn robes, (abscissa sinu) or an Amazon, roused
 to battle. There is indeed some confusion in this simile, for the Thermo-
 don was a river b( Pontus, described by Pliny (N. H. vi. 3) as rising in
 the Amazonian mountains; and, on the other hand, there were no Ama-
 zons in Thrace. Propertius, however, is so fond of showing his reading,
 that he sometimes makes strange jumbles of what he had read.

 76. Deliciia.-Da.inties, opposed to the ordinary De of the country
 people in their earthen platters, pagamfercula.—Immundos. Soiled with
 smoke through which they had been leaping.

 83. Festague remigum-u And, because it was a holiday, unguarded."—
 Occupat erue, (φθάνει παίουσα, Paley,) cuts the dogs’ throats by way of pre-
 caution.—Pamis cuts, the punishment which he meant to exact from Tar-

 la.

 Pe87. Porno fdem, i.e. sibi commissum. Her father, Tarpeius, was war-
 den of the castle, and the keeping of the gate was entrusted to his daugh-
 ten—Jamlem, in sleep. ‘ Omnia prabebant somnos,’ v. 85.

 91. lnqeetia amit-According to Livy (i. 1 l). the temptation of Tarpeia
 was not love, but avarice; not a passion for Tatius, but a desire to possess
 the bracelets and collars of gold of the Sabines. She promised to betray
 her charge if they would give her those bright things which they had upon
 their arms. So she opened a gate, and let in the Ssbines; and they, as
 they came in, by a pardouable equivocation (⁴ neque enim sceleri dedit
 hostis honorem'), cast upon her their bright shields, which they bore on
 their arms, and crushed her to death. Niebuhr remarking upon the poeti-
 cal character of the story, says (Rom. Hist. i. p. 229, E. T.)‚ “ The Roman
 poet conceived that the poor Sabine: were covered with gold, as Fauriel
 observes that the bards of modern Greece conceive of their Clepts. Here
 the marks of popular poetry are so clear that none who have eyes can
 mistake them. It is in the very spirit that created all the splendour and
 the treasures in the house of Menelaus (Odyss. ix. 40). The ﬁction in
 Propertius seems to be a transfer, unwarranted by any tradition, from
 the story of Scylla of Megan.” In Ovid (Fast. i. 260—272) we have an-
 other particular of the legend. Janus takes to himself the credit of raising
 a barrier against the Sabine: by scalding them:

 ⁴ Oraque, qua pollen· ope sum, fontaua reclusi
 Sumque repentinas ejaculatus aquas.
 Ante tameu calidis subjeci sulfura venis,
 Clauderet ut Tatio fervidus humor iter.’

 94. 11;}th certia-Spurius Tarpeius was slain by the Sabines, though
 he was innocent of his daughter's treachery.

 Ens. X. The following extract from Mr. Merivale’s Hist. of Rome
 will serve to explain many passages in this Elegy, which, as Barth oh-
 serves, is an Epinician ode on the occasion of the fourth celebration of the
 Ludi Actiaci, or gamen established by Augustus in memory of his victory
 over Arii-onius and Cleopatra at Actium. 3.0. 31. The date of the Elegy
 is 11.0. 5.

 “ As a perpetual memorial of this complete and ﬁnal triumph, he founded

 W;

 a city upon the site of his camp, and gave to it the name of Nicopolis, the
 City of Victory. The spot on which his own tent had been pitched he
 mused to be paved with masonry, as holy ground, and suspended around
 it the beaks of the captured vessels. Here be erected a shrine to his
 patron, Apollo (v. 29), and commemorated with punctilious superstition
 the fancied omens of his success. . . . Augustus instituted a gymnic and
 musical festival, with the designation of the Actian Games, to recur at
 this spot every ﬁfth year, and this solemnity continued to be observed for
 many generations} See Sueton. August. 55 18, 29.

 1-10. Sacra facit . . . itm-The ﬁrst ten verses of this Elegy are me-
 taphorical. The poet assumes the functions of a priest about to perform
 a solemn sacriﬁce. He oﬂ’ers one of the nobler victims (juvenca), wears
 a wreath of ivy-berries corymbis), is provided with sacriﬁcial gums
 and perfumes (costum, tus , with pure water from the spring (urna lym-
 phis), recites a form of words, a prayer (carmen), holding the woollen
 chaplet (lam orbis), standing by an altar of fresh turf (recenlt'btu aris),
 and accompanied by a Phrygian ﬂute (tibia Myydoniis), etc. He depre-
 cates evil words, omens, persons (ἑκάς, ἑκάς ἐστε βέβηλοι . . . ὅστις ἀλιτρός),
 etc., and waves a laurel-branch (pura laurea), in honour of Apollo Actius.
 In vv. 3, 4, the epithetical words Philetas and Cyrenm's refer to the mo-
 dels of Propertius, Philetas of Cos, and Callimachus of Cyrene. On this
 somewhat protracted metaphor, Hertzberg, quoted by Mr. Paley, ad. loa,
 observes z ‘ ln allegoria, qua: decem primos versus obtinet, magnopere
 cavendum est, ne sd vivam resecare metaphoras, neque quae singula signi-
 ﬁcent, anxie quaerere velimus. Quid enim juveuca, quid costum, quid
 lsneus orbis, quid denique lymth translatione solute in carmine signiﬁ-
 cent, putidum est explorare.’

 8. Mygdoniia . . . India—And from Phrygiau vessels let the ivory ﬂute
 pour forth its stream of song—Fraud“ . . . name. Secret and open evils,
 all noxious things visible or invisible. Compare Fletcher’s Faithful Shep-
 herdess, A. iii. so. l:

 Let your odour drive from thence
 All mlstes that dazzle sense.’

 And, on the contrary, charms were used to produce fraudes, name. See
 Milton’s Camus, 153: ί Thus I hurl

 My dazzling spells into the spongy sir,
 Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,
 And give it false presentments.’

 ll. Palatini Apollinis aedem-See note on VII. 3.

 15. Athamana ad litora ; i. e. the shores of Epirus. Athamania was a
 district in the south-east of Epirus, between Mount Pindus and the river
 Aracthus. The river Achelous ﬂowed through it.—Simu. The Sinus Am-
 bracius, the present Gulf of Arta. It is an arm of the Ionian Sea.- Pelague
 is the sinus in this instance, though it is generally used of the open sea.

 Mandi mama—0n the side of Augustus was mustered the force of the
 Western Empire; on that of Antonius and Cleopatra, the force of the
 Eastern; and with the following verses (19—30) compare the magniﬁcent
 lines of Virgil, Eneid, viii. 678—690.—Moln pinea. Id. ib. 693: ‘ Tanta

  

 exornamus. n 187

 founder of Rome, descendant (in legendary belief) of Teucer, the founder
 of Troy, became, aher death, the god Quirinus, and the natural protector
 of his adapting—Sign vincere docta. The Roman ﬂeet had been taught
 to conquer at sea by Agrippa in the war with Sextus Pompeius.

 25. Nereus honoret in arcum-The god of the sea had arranged the
 hostile ﬂeet in two opposing curves, when Phtebus, the especial patron of
 Augustus, takes his station, in the form of a waving ﬂame, on the poop of
 Caesar’s galley. So Eschylus (Ἢ emn. 647) represents Fortune as
 perching like a bird on the ship. . Paley, in his note on the line,—
 Τύχη δὲ σωτὴρ ναῶν θέλουσ) legam-thinks that the allusion, ‘ﬂamma
 ünuata,’ is ‘to that common electric light (now called St. Elmo’s ﬁre),
 which also gave rise to the fable of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux) ap-
 pearing in a storm.’ ,

 27. Belem—Comp. Virgil, Eneid, iii. 73:

 ‘ Sacra mari colitur medio gratissima tellus
 Nereidum matri et Neptuno Egaeoe
 Quam pius Arcitenens, oras et litora circum
 Errantem, Gyaro celsa Myconoque revinxit,
 Immotumque coli dedit, et oontemnere ventos.’

 shaken wonder of the earth; and it is said to have derived its name (Δῆλος,
 the clear island ’) from its ﬁxity; for whereas, when it ﬂoated, its site was
 uncertain and invisible, so soon as it was bound in adamantine chains by
 Zeus, all men saw it plainly among its fellow Cyclades. Down to the
 age of Pliny (N. H. iv. 12, § 22) this island, though seated in a volcanic
 region, had only twice, within the memory of men,-been' shaken by earth-
 quakes, snd, on each occasion, the phenomenon was regarded with dismay
 by the whole of Greece. It was the birth-place of Apollo and Artemis.

 31-36. ‘ His garb of peace aside the god had laid;
 His locks no longer o’er his shoulders strayed:
 No dulcet tones resounded from his lyre,
 But wroth, as when the Greeks provoked his ire,
 He heaped the Doric camp with piles of slain,
 And glued indignant on the king of men.
 Or, as when gazing on the slackening coil
 Of the huge Python, stretched upon the soil,—
 Pytho, from whom the unwarlike Muses ﬂed,—
 So stood Apollo then, most wrathful and most dread.’

 The allusion is to the pestilence in the Grecian camp before Troy, which
 Homer embodies in the person of Apollo. Iliad, i. 40—50.

 40. Hoc onus omne-The full burden of my quiver. So ‘pharetraa
 pondus,’ infra, v. 55.

 43. Romulus murorum uuquam-Before tracing the plan of his city, Ro-
 mulus observed the heavens. See Livy, i. 6: ‘ Ut dii quorum tutelae ea loca
 essent, auquriis legerent qui nomen novae urbi dual—Palatine aves.
 The twelve vultures seen by Romulus. Id. ib.

 45. Nimium remia audent.-⁴ They take too much upon them: the
 sea, no less than the land, is your domain; and it is ι scandal to Romans
 if the waves endure ships led by kings.‘ The passage is very obscure:
 probably the emphatic word in it is reyia, since Antonius had previously
 wounded Roman prejudices by assuming for himself, Cleopatra, and their
 sons, the style and title of “ king of kings ;" and many kings were among
 his allies at Actium. See Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra, act
 sc. 6, translating Plutarch =

 ‘ He now is levying
 ne ﬂags 0’ the earth for war. He hath assembled
 Bocchus, the king of Lybia; Archelaus,
 Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
 Of Paphlagonis; the Thracian king, Adallas,’ etc.

 49. Centauros saxa minantem-L-Centaurs hurling stones against the
 Lapithae seem to have been painted on the prows of Antonius’s ships.—

 · Pictos metus. They are but painted terrors, sc. boards. "Tis the eye of

 childhood that fears a painted devil’ (Macbeth, act i. sc. 2). The Egyp-
 tians painted their boats with designs of men or gods: ‘Et circa pictis
 vehitur sua rura phaselis’ (V irg. Georg. iv. 289).—Temporü auctor. Fear
 not‚’C:esar‚ the event; 1, Apollo, have ‘the ordering of this present sea-
 son.

 56. Cman'a kaum—Tim ascription of personal prowess to the leader of
 a battle has often been copied, untrue and absurd as it is, by modern
 poets, by none more absurdly than by Addison, in his Poem of ‘The
 Campaign,’ in imitation of Silius Italicus.

 59. Idalio ab utrm-At the time of Julius Caesar’s death a comet is
 reported to have appeared, which was imagined to be his.spirit translated
 to the skies (Sueton. Jul. 88; Ovid, Metamorph. xv. nub jin). A medal
 was struck in honour of Augustus. after his decease, in which he is repre-
 sented with Caesar’s star resting upon his head; according to Virgil’s de-
 scription (Eueid, 680):

 to Aphrodite, the mother of Illness, and, consequently, the divine ances-
 tress of the Julian race; v. 60 :

 to die by her own hand, and at her own hour. She Was not led in tri-
 umph by the conqueror, nor, like Jugurtha after the procession, cast into

 Quaa scribuntur aquae putoribus. . . .
 Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus:
 Ennius ipse pater nunquam, nisi potus, ad arma
 Prosiluit diceuda.’

 76. Bacche . . . Phoebo tum-’The conjunction of the sun-god with the
 wine-god was conceived by later mythologists: originally they were hos-
 tile deities; the latter representing the orgiastic, the former the pure an-
 thropomorphic worship of the Greeks. Parnassus was sacred to both
 ~ deities. Juvenal (Sat. 64) :

 ‘ Dominis Cirrha Nysaeque {eruntur
 Pectora nostra.‘

 Comp. Tibullus, El. 4. 44:

 , ⁴ Caste nam rite poeta
 thbusque et Bacchus Pieridesque favent.’

 77. Sicambru.—The Sicambri, in the time of Julius Caesar, occupied
 the eastern bank of the Rhine, extending from the Sieg to the Lippe ‚- but
 alarmed by his advances, and especially by the bridge which he threw
 across the Rhine, they withdrew into forests and morasses inaccessible to
 the Romans. At the date of this poem, however, they had resumed their
 former position. and, in ac. 16, were in Gallia Belgica, where they corn-
 pletely routed M. Lollius, and a strong force of legions.—Cepheam Me-
 roen. Cepheus was an ancient king of Meroe, a huge island, which lay
 between the conﬂuence of the Astapus, the Astaboras, and the Nile.
 It is called an island, but it is properly a vast irregular tract, like Meso-
 potamia. The sun was vertical there forty-ﬁve days before the summer
 solstice, whence Milton (‘Paradise Regained,’ book iv.) speaks of it as
 ‘ Meroe, Nilotic isle ;’ ‘ where the shadow both way falls.’

 Euro. XI. Jupiter was named ‘ Feretrius,’ or Bearer, as the spoils of the
 enemy’s general, if slain by a Roman commander, were bone to him.
 They were called Spolia opima (Liv. iv. 20; Festus, a. v.), *magnilica et
 ampla,’ and were most rarely won, and not always accorded by the senate.

 190 novas on

 When M. Crassns, in the ﬁfth consulship of Augustus, n.c. 29, slew Deldo,’
 king of the Bastarnse, he was refused the spolia opima, because he was
 held to be acting sub ductu et amiciis of another, i. e. Caesar himself.
 Varro, indeed (quoted by Festus, l. c.), says, ‘ Opims spolia esse [etiam]
 si manipularis miles detraxerit dummodo duci hostium ;’ but this state-
 ment does not accord with Plutarch’s assertion (Marcell. 8), that Roman
 history, down to his own time, aﬂ'orded but three examples: 1st, when
 Romulus slew Acro, king oi the Cwninenses; 2nd, when Cornelius Cossus
 slew Lar Tolumnius,king of Veii; 3rd, when M. Claudius Marcellus slew Viri-
 domarus, king of the Gaesatae. (¹Armaque de ducibus trina recepta tribus,⁷
 v. 2.) This Elegy, which formed a portion of the intended Fasti of Pro-
 pertinl, was perhaps suggested by the restoration of the temple of Jupiter
 Feretrius by Augustus, then Octavianus, Caesam-Feretrius is derived from
 ferre, φερέτριος, φέρειν, φέρεσθαι.

 1. Causae, the origin of the name of Jupiter, ‘ the spoil-bearer.’ ‘ Causa
 Feretri,’ infra, 45. Ovid opens his Fasti with ‘Tempora cum causis.’—
 Arma, und. ‘ maul—Magnum iter ascendo.

 ⁸ Ah, who can tell how hard it is to climb
 The steep where Fame’s proud temple shines afar ?’

 (Besttie's Minstrel, i.) —Evmum equum. Romulus hurled Acron from his

 horse, and the horse upon him-Herculeus. Acron was a Sabine king, and

 gerenies, or, as he was called, ‘ Sancus,’ was said to be the founder of the
 abina nation.

 l4. Votis occupat ante ratim-Romulus, according to Plutarch (Rom.
 c. 16), ‘ made a vow, that if he conquered Aaron, he would dedicate his
 opponent’s arms to Jupiter.’ The vow was registered and fulﬁlled, vota
 rata ,· and Livy (i. 10) proceeds: ‘ Inde exercitu victore reducto, ipse quum
 factis vir magnificus, tum factorum ostentator haud minor spolia ducis hos-
 tium csesi suspensa fabricato ad id apte ferculo (φερέτρφ) gerens in Capi-

 pated Acron in Jupiter⁷s good-will.-Sic vim-ere,- i. e. ‘ pietate erga deos
 et virtute erga homines.’--Aprico. Without a roof over his head.

 21. Pyropo.—Pliny (N. H. xxxiv. 20) says that pyropus was an amal-
 gam of gold and brusa-Inducta, laid on in plates. [Es] ⁸ Coronarium
 tennatur in laminas; idemque in uncias additis auri scrupulis senis, prae·
 tenui pyropi bractea ignescit.⁹ The pyropus of Ovid (Metamorph. ii. 2),
 ‘ ﬂammas imitante pyropo,⁷ gleamed like a carbuncle, and must therefore
 have been different from this gilt bronze.

 28. Aurea selim-The golden chair of the principal Lucumon or king.
 The insignia of the Roman kings, pmtors, and consuls, were derived from
 Etruria (Livy, i. 8).-Nunc intra muros, etc. Veii was so completely
 destroyed by Camillus, its ruins having been employed as building-mate-
 rials for the reconstruction of Rome after the retreat of the Gauls, me.
 365, that hardly a vestige remained of this great city in the time of Pro-

 ertius.
 p 34. Vinea haym-The long shed or pent-house under which the soldiers
 worked the battering-ram.

 39. Claudium-This is the Marcellus commemorated by Virgil, Eneid,
 vi. 856:

 Pnornn’rws. 191

 ‘ Aspice, ut insignis spoliis Marcellus opimis
 Ingreditur, victorque viros supereminet omnes.
 Hic rem Romanam, magno turbante tumultu,
 Sistet, eques sternet Puenos, Gallumque rebellem,
 Tertiaque arma patri suspendet capta Quirino.’

 --Trajectos. A Rheno in Italiam-Vasti ducis. Viridomarus, or Brito-
 martus, was king or general of the Gauls, and was besieging Clastidium,
 in Liguria, when Marcellus won his armour in a duel. He was a man of
 gigantic size. Plutarch (Marcell. 6): ἀνὴρ μεγέθει τε σώματος ἔξοχος Γαλα-
 τῶν, καὶ πανοπλίᾳ ἐν ἀργύρῳ καὶ χρυσῷ καὶ βαφαῖς καὶ πᾶσι ποικίλμασιν,
 amp ἀστραπὴ διαφέρων στιλβούσῃ-Τροέίε rotis. The wheels of the war-
 chariot were close together, and so were concealed by the body of the car.

 47. Virgatis Mamie—Trousers striped with cross bars, like the plaids
 of the modern Gaels ol' Sentland. Comp. Virgil, Eneid, viii. 659, who
 thus describes the appearance of the Gauls :

 ‘ Aurea caesaries ollis atque aurea vestis =
 Virgatis lucent sagulis: tum lactea colla
 Auro innectuntur: duo quisque Alpina coruscant
 Guess manu, scutis protecti corpora longis.’

 44. Torquis.-The Celtic torque derives its name from being made of
 twisted gold wire. ,In their dress and on their armour the Gauls were
 lavish of gold. The torques and more solid crowns of gold, preserved in
 the Museum of Trinity College, Dublin, apart from their worth to arch-
 aeology, are of immense metallic value. Unca is the clasp, or book-and-
 eye, of the torquis. The order suggested by Mr. Paley of this obscure
 couplet is, ‘illi, nempe Claudio, torquis (unca) decidit ab gula incisa Viri-
 dumari, virgatis braccis induti, jaculantis ab agmine suo.’

 Emma. XII. This Elegy is an imaginary address from a deceased wife, ἶ I ‘

 Cornelia, to her husband, Emilius Puullus, who was Censor in the year
 ac. 22. Cornelia was the daughter of Scribonia, wife, at one time, of
 P. Cornelius Scipio, who subsequently married Augustus Cmsar. She was
 divorced by Caesar on his marriage with Livia, on the pretext of incom-
 patible temper. ‘Pertaesus ut scribit' [Augustus] ‘morum perversita-
 tem ejus.’ It appears from v. 66, that Propertius composed this poem
 in 3.0. l6, consequently it is the latest of his extant writings. ‘It may
 fairly be regarded,’ says Mr. Paley, ‘as the masterpiece of the poet’s
 genius. It is a splendid composition, full of pathos and eloquent appeal,
 and is, on the whole, worthy of the almost extravagant praises which
 editors of the poet have bestowed upon it.’

 Tiber. 5 2; Valer. Max. i. 8, § 11. A ship conveying an image of Cy-
 bele from Phrygia, stuck fast in a shallow at the Tiber’s mouth. The
 augurs proclaimed that none but a virtuous woman could draw it all" the
 bar. Claudia had been accused of having broken her vows. She stepped
 forward among the matrons who had accompanied Scipio to Ostia, prayed
 to the gods to vindicate her innocence, took hold of the rope, and forth-
 with the vessel followed her. A statue was erected to Claudia in the
 temple of Cybele (' turritae dese’).—C'ua‘, i.e. Emilia. Emilia was also a

 There is a noble passage in the Agsmemnon of Eschylus, v. 410, con-
 taining a similar image :
 Ὀνειρόφαντοι δὲ πενθήμονες
 Πάρεισι δόξαι φέρουσαι χάριν ματαίαν.
 Μάτων γὰρ, εὖτ’ ἃν ἐσθλά τις δοκῶν ὁρᾶν,
 napum-deam» διὰ χερῶν
 Βέβακεν ὄψις οὐ μεθύστερον
 Πτεροΐς ὀπαδοῖς ὕπνον κελεύθοις-

 And for the concluding lines of this Elegy, 70—96, Propertius is under
 obligations to the Alcestis of Euripides, 355 foll.:

 Ἐν δ’ ὀνείρασι
 {ion-Gad μ’ εὐφραίνοις ἄν· ἡδὺ ’γὰρ φίλος
 . Καὶν νυκτὶ λεύσσειν, δντιν ἂν παρῇ χρόνον.

 85. Adversum . . . kaum—Jan“ is the door oi the aula, is. atrium,
 ‘ lectus genialis in aula* (Horace, Epist. i. l. 87). The lectus (genialis) is
 called adventu. because it stood opposite the door. Ascon. in Milonian:
 ‘ Lectulum adversum uxoris . . . fregerunt.’ If the man married a second
 time, the bed was changed.

 Sederit cauta noverca. Cauta, on her guard over her own children,
 and against the orphans of Cornelia. It is a gentle way of hinting the
 proverbial injustice of mothers-in-law. Comp. Laberius, ⁴ Compitalia ap.
 Gellium,’ xvi. 9:

 ‘ Nunc tu lentus es: nunc tn susque deque fers
 Msterfamilias tua in lecto adverso sedet.’

 93. Discite venturam-With these beautiful lines may be compared the
 equally beautiful verses of Pope (Epistle to Arbuthnot):

 ⁴ Me let the tender oﬂice long engage,
 To rock the cradle of reposing age,
 With lenient arts extend a mother’s breath,
 Make languor smile, and smooth the bed of death,
 Explore the thought, explain the asking eye,
 And keep awhile one parent from the sky.’

 97. Nunquam luqubria sumpsi-I have never put on mourning for a
 child—Toto caterva. All my children came to my funeral.——Causa pero-

 Eprs'r. ABIADNE Tnnsao. All that is necessary to know of the story
 of Theseus and Ariadne has been told in the notes on the ‘ Epithalamium ¹
 of Catullus, mpra, p. 122 foll. Many local allusions and illustrative pas-
 sages will be found there also.

 3. Ex illo litora-The shores of the island Naxos, or Dia.

 25. Mom—Mount Dryon. Compare Catull. Epithal.: v. 70.

 ‘ Ac tum praeruptos tristem conscendere montes,
 Unde aciem in pelagi vastos protenderet aestus.’

 Scopulus is the termination of a mass of rocks, especially a headland
 abutting on the shore, or running out into the sea. Thus in Crete, mom
 Ida is a chain of hills; Dicte and Dryon are scopuli.

 45. Potius quam-Sub. ut.

 48. 0gygio.—Ogyges, or Ogygus, is sometimes called an antochthon of
 Bmotia, sometimes a son of Bceotus the autochthon. His subjects were
 named Hectenes, and the land, afterwards Bmotia, Ogygia, from this very
 ancient legendary king. And since Bacchus came at some very remote
 pre-historic period to this land, the‘ epithet Ogygius, ‘very ancient,’ is
 bestowed on him. Ὠγύγιαι-’ῖς an epithet denoting extreme antiquity in
 cities: it is applied by Eschylus, Pers. 37, to Egyptian Thebes; to Bceotian

 also of other parts of the body recumbent or sitting. Cicero, Verrin.
 34: ‘ Praesertim quum in lecto vestigia viderent recentia.’

 54. Intepuere.——‘ Were still warm.’

 62. Per ambigmu via1.-⁴ Precarious tracks.’

 66. Ezul.—This word designates a person who had withdrawn from
 his native country, in order to escape the punishment of some civil or
 political oﬁ‘ence there by him committed, and who became a citizen of a.
 foreign state. Ariadne ﬂed from Crete, to avoid her father's wrath for
 her crime of aiding Theseus against the Minotaur, and purposed to take
 up her abode at Athens, the exilium, or foreign home, she had chosen.
 The poet, in this passage, therefore employs exul in its strictly legal
 sense. See Niebuhr, Rom. Hist. ii. p. 65. E.T. 3rd edit.

 67. Crete, centum digesta per urbere-Virgil, Eneid, 106:

 ‘ Centum urbes habitant magnae, uberrima regna.’

 Great as the number may appear, Crete, in its ﬂourishing days, actually
 contained as many cities or towns as the poets ascribe to it, since the
 geographers, Stephanus of Byzantium, Ptolemy, and Strabo, accord in their
 reckoning with the poets (Homer, Iliad, ii. 649; Horace, Carm. iii. 27.
 34; Epod. ix. 29). These cities were destroyed by Q. Metellus Creticus
 in 3.0. 67, but ruins belonging to many of these may still be traced. Α
 list of the Cretan towns is given in Smith’s ‘Dictionary of Geography,’
 vol. i. p. 705.—Puero Jovi. Jupiter, or rather the Cretan Zeus, grew up
 in Crete, concealed in a cavern of Mount Dicte, where he was nursed by
 the Curetes and the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, upon the milk of the
 goat Amaltheia, and the honey of the mountain bees. Crete was one of
 the most ancient seats of the worship of Zeus (Eneid, iii. 104; Dionys.
 Perieg. 501). Among the portions of the island peculiarly sacred to him
 was Cnosus, which was said to have been built by the Curetes, and where
 Minos ruled and conversed with him (Homer, Odyss. xix. I72).

 71. Tecto recurvo (v. 328. Sectaque per dubias saxea tecta vias), ‘ the
 labyrinth,’ the covered building whose passages wind back on themselves.
 See note on Catullus, Epithalamium, ex.

 79. Qum sum passura.———‘ Nor do I call to mind the suﬂ’erings or dangers
 which I, Ariadne, here and now am likely to endure; but the general
 woes and dangers to which every deserted woman is exposed.’—Recordor,
 applying to what may and probably will happen, as well as to what has
 already happened, is used by Justin, v. 7 : ‘ Sibi quisque ante oculos obsi-
 dionem, famem et superbiam victoremque hostem proponentes: jam
 ruinam urbis et incendia, jam omnium captivitatem et miserrimam servi.
 tutem recardantea.’ Meminisse in employed in similar manner, id. xi. 5 :
 ‘ Nec belli periculorumque, sed divitiarum meminerant.’

 82. Morsque minus . . . morm-That which may happen in the interim.
 Comp. Sallust, Catilin. c. 51 : ⁴ In luctu atque miseriis mortem aerumnarum
 requiem, non cruciatum esse.’

  

 ovm. 199

 83. Jam, jam emtum.—Ariadne’s fears of wild-beasts were unfounded.
 Crete, according to JElian (N. A. iii. 32) and Pliny (N. H. viii. 83), was
 free from all wild-beasts and noxious animals, an exemption which it
 owed to Heracles (Diod. Sicul. iv. 17). This assertion, indeed, seems
 strange in the face of other circumstances, viz. that the Cretan hounds
 vied with those of Sparta (Elian, ib. iii. 2), and that the Cretan archers
 were in high repute (Xenoph. Anab. iii. 3; Thucyd. vii. 57). The wild
 goats of the island (ay-rimi) may perhaps have exercised both dogs and men.

 91. Pasiphae, mother of Ariadne and Phaedra, was the daughter of
 Helios and Perseia, and sister of Circe and Eetes.

 Nusquam recta acies; livent rubigine dentes,

 Pectora felle virent, lingua est suffusa veueno;

 Sed videt ingratos, intabescitque videndo,

 Successus homimum carpitque, et carpitur nun;

 Suppliciumque suum est.’

 the Pleiades, or seven stars of Alexandrian literature. He wrote the
 ‘ Phaeuomena ’ (Φαινομένα), a short astronomical poem, which was trans-
 lated by Cicero, by Germanicus Caesar, and by Festus Avienus, in the
 reign of Diocletian or Theodosius. Quintilian (Instit. Orat. x. l, 5 55)
 holds this work (the Diosemeia) rather cheap; ‘ Arati materia motu caret,

 seeks the sportive character his subject; he depicts in human characters

 The poet was more conﬁdent of a perpetual name when he had com-
 pleted his ‘ Metamorphosebn Libri ’ (xv. 87l):

 Quum volet illa dies, quw nil nisi corporis hujus

 Quaque patet domitis Romana potentia terris,
 Ore legar populi ; perque omnia szecula fama,

 Si quid habent veri vatum praesagia, vivam.’ κ [μς ,

 TBAGCEDIB m Emma: CONTENTIO. A passion for heroic or dramatic
 composition prevailed among the readers, and very generally among the
 poets of the Augustan age. Rome, since the destruction oi* Carthage, had
 performed such mighty acts. and during the civil wars had witnessed so
 many tragic events, in the excitation of the low and the humiliation or
 extinction of the great, that the contemporaries of the second Caesar not
 unnaturally desired the stage and literature to embody some of the inci-
 dents

 ‘ That bore a weighty and a serious brow,
 Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe;
 Such noble scenes as draw the eye to ﬂow.’
 (Prologue to Henry VIII.)

 But, although the wish was general and not unreasonable, the subjects
 were not well suited to either epic or tragic poetry; nor, with one ex-
 ception, have any of the numerous heroic poems of this period been pre-
 served. Virgil alone possessed a genius commensurate with epic dignity;
 and even he is more indebted to the sweetness and majesty of his versiﬁ-
 cation than to the interest of his story, or the originality of his conceptions,
 for the preservation of his work.

 We have already heard Propertius protesting against a request that he
 should attempt a loftier strain than elegiae verse (Eleg. vi.). Ovid
 now pleads for similar freedom of choice. He did not indeed always shun
 the higher and more ambitious road, since he composed a tragedy, ⁴ Medea,’
 and in his Metamorphoses aims at, and not unfrequentiy attains to, epic
 grandeur. The causes for the inferiority of Rome in these branches of

 composition are fully and clearly enumerated by Α. W. Schlegel, in his
 ‘ Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature.’ (Lect. xv.)
 ixl-legen vetus, eta-This verse is nearly repeated by the author in Fast.
 ‘ Silva vetus nullaque din violets securi
 Stabat, Maenalio sacra relicta deo.’

 The scenery, so to speak, of a dense wood (im-(edua), a cavern, a foun-
 tain, the song of birds, etc., were liberally copied from the Roman by the
 medieval poets, and transmitted by them to Dante, Chaucer, etc. Eg.
 The Divine Comedy opens thus:
 ‘In the midway of this our mortal life,

 I found me in a gloomy wood ,-

 ...... savage, wild

 That forest, and robust and rough its growth.’

 (Gary’s Translation.)

 And Chaucer, ‘ The Flower and the Leaf :’

 ‘ And on I put my genre and mine array,
 And to a pleasaunt grove l gan passe
 Long er the bright suune uprisen was.
 In which were okes grete, straight as a line,
 And eke the briddee [birds¹] range for to here
 Would have rejoiced any earthly wight.’

 8. Pee longior. The hexameter verse of the elegiac couplet.—In pedibus
 vitium refers to the per brevior, the pentameter.

 ll. [menti passm-*With lon strides.‘—Fronte comte torva. This was
 the tire or periwig (φενάκη, ἰι-ην κη), covering the head, worn by actors.
 ‘ Most of the male wigs were collected into a foretop (ὄγκος), which was
 an angular projection above the forehead, shaped like a A, and was pro-
 bably borrowed from the κρωβύλον of the old Athenians. The female
 masks were surmounted in similar manner.’ (Donaldson’s ‘ Theatre of the
 Greeks,’ p. 147, 5th ed.)—Palla is originally pellic, a robe made of the skin
 of a wild-beast, as in lEneid, xi. 576: ‘ Pro longs: tegmine anlm, Tigridis
 exuviae, per dorsum a vertice pendent.’ Then it came to signify a player’s
 robe. ‘Eschylus . . . paline repertor honestw,’ Horace, A. P. 278.—Jacebat
 humi. ⁸ It was trailing on the ground.’

 - ‘ Let gorgeous Tragedy
 In sceptred pail come sweeping by.’
 (Milton, Il Penseroso.)

 ⁶ Almost all the actors in a tragedy wore long striped garments reaching
 to the ground (χιτῶνες ποδήρεις), over which were thrown upper garments
 of purple, or some other brilliant colour.‘ (Mueller and Donaldson’s Hist.
 of Greek Literature, vol. i. p. 393.)—Lydiua cothurnus. It is doubtful
 whether Ovid refers in the epithet Lydius to Etruria,'a reputed colony
 from Lydia, or to the fact that the Lydians proper were said to be the
 inventors of popular games and amusements. Herodotus, i. 94: φασὶ δὲ
 αὐτοὶ Λυδοὶ καὶ τὰς παιγνίας τὰς νῦν σφίσι τε καὶ ’Ἕλλησι κατεστεῶτας
 ἑαυτῶν ἐξεύρημα γένεο-θαι. The cothurmu of the tragic actors was raised

  

 ovm. 203

 by thicksoles, probably by the insertion of layers of cork, in order that
 the wearer might appear tall and majestic. Hence, Tragedy in general is
 termed ‘ Cothurnus.’ (Juvenal, Sat. vi. 633.)

 11!: “ﬁel ﬁfteenth Elegy of the third book · Amorum,’ Ovid bids farewell to
 t e egino muse:

 ‘ Quere novum vatem, tenerorum mater Amorum:
 Raditur hic Elegis ultima meta meis.’

 But as he subsequently composed, in the same measure and in similar
 strain, his *Ars Amatoria’ and ‘ Remedium Amoris,’ his ⁸ Farewell to the
 Lighter Mnses’ was premature.

 An MAcauu Poguu. Ovid was on terms of intimacy with two poets
 of the name of Macer: (1) Emilius Maeer of Verona, who was older than
 Ovid, and died in 3.0. 16. He wrote poems on birds, snakes, and medi-
 cli‘nalrpll‘ants, and his productions, wholly lost, are thus commemorated in
 t e ' tin. ii.=

 ⁴ Saepe suas volucres legit mihi grandior aevo,
 Quaeque necet serpens, que juvet herba. Macer.’

 (2) Maeer, whose praenomen and cognomen are unknown, wrote on Ho-
 merie themes (hence, *Iliacus Macer,’ Ex Pout. iv. 16. 6), and is the
 person to whom these verses are addressed.

 Long aﬁerwards Ovid, then an exile on the shores of the Black Sea,
 addresses him as an old travelling companion, who had visited Sicily and
 Asia Minor with him (Epist. ex Pont. ii. 10. 21):

 ‘ Te duce, magniﬁcas Asia perspeximus urbes:
 Trinacris est oculis, te duce, nota meis;’

 and alludes to his fame as an imitator of Homer:

 ‘ Tu canis aeterno quicquid restabat Homero,
 Ne careant summa Troica fata manu ! ’

 We may infer from Apuleius De Orthograph. § 18, that the title of
 Maeer’s poem was ‘ Bellum Trojanum.’

 l. Carmen ad iratum-Macer therefore-began with the beginning of
 the Tale of Troy. and carried down his poem to the epoch at which the
 Iliad opens, ‘ the wrath of Achilles.‘-~Prima armajuratie viris. The ﬁrst
 muster of the confederates under Agamemnon’s command, at Aulis. He
 seems to have followed, if, indeed, he did not merely abridge or translate.
 the Cypria of Stasinus, a poem in eleven books, in which the events that
 led to the war and the nine years' contest before the walls of Troy are
 recorded. The Iliad begins in the tenth year of the war. See Mueller
 and Donaldson’s Hist. of Greek Literature, vol. i. p. 92.

 4. Arum-as grandia.—‘ Often purposing, and on the point of taking in
 hand, some lofty theme.’ So Horace, Sat. ii. 3. 9: ‘Atqui vultus erst

 19—26. Ovid in these lines enumerates some of his imaginary Epistles
 from heroes to heroines, to which Sabinus (27) furnished poetic answers,
 six in number. Sabinus appears from the following verses (Ovid, Ex Pout.
 iv. 16. 13) to have written an epic poem :

 ‘ Quique suum Troezena, imperfectumque dierum
 Deseruit celeri morte Sabinus opus,’

 on the subject of Theseus, born at Trcezen, in Argolis. The ¹ opus imper-
 fectum diemm’ may have been a continuation or complement of Ovid’s
 Fasti. The Epistolm of Sabinus, sometimes printed in editions of Ovid,
 are the modern productions of one Angelus Sabinus, who lived about

 companions from the ﬁre-breathing bulls and dragon of Colchis.——-Leobis,

 the early incidents of the war of Troy.—A vestris in mea caetra. A Martis
 ad Amoris castra. See Amor. i. 9. 1 :

 ‘ Militat omnis amans, et habet sua castra, Cupido:
 Attice, crede mihi: militat omnis amans.’

 IN Mon'rEM Psrrmcr. From Pliny (N. H. x. 42. § 58) and Apuleius
 (Florida, p. 125, ed. Bipont.) it appears that the green parrot, or parro-
 quet, alone was known to the Romans. The former describes it thus:
 ‘ India hanc avem mittit, sittacen vocat, viridem toto corpore, torque tan-

 tum miniato in cervice distinctam. Imperatores salutat, et quae accipit
 verba, pronuntiat, in vino principue lasciva. Capiti ejus duritia eadem
 quae rostro. Hoc, cum loqui discit, ferreo verberatus radio: non sentit
 aliter ictus. Cum devolat, rostro se excipit, illi innititur levioremque se
 ita pedum infirmitati facit.’ Apuleius had read Pliny⁷4 description, but
 adds to it further particulars: e.g. *Discit autem statim pullus usque sd
 duos aetatis suae annos, dum facile os uti conformetur. . . . Senex autem
 captus et indocilis est et obliviosus. . . . Ad disciplinam humani sermonis
 facilior est, glande qui vescitur.’ Parrots were accounted sacred birds in
 the East, and allowed to build their nests and breed in the parks and
 gardens of the Indian kings. Elian, Hist. Anim. xiii. 18. The Greek
 naturalist was acquainted with the grey parrot (xvi. 2). The African
 parrot was not known at Rome before the reign of Nero (Pliny, Η. Ν. vi.
 29). See Penny Magazine, ‘ Psittacidae.’

 5. Horﬁda.—Rough, undressed, in token of mourning.

 9. Divertite.-⁸ Turn away, ye birds, from the obsequies of Itys; that is
 an old story: and turn to (advertite) those of this your rare, priceless

 ll. Omnes.—Und. εἰώθει-Ἰωνίαν. Between the turtle-dove and the
 parrot the ancients believed there was some aﬂinity. Ovid, Heroid. xv.
 38: ‘ Et niger a viridi turtur amatur ave,’ Le. psittaco. Comp. Pliny,
 Apuleius, ll.cc. In a poem sometimes ascribed to Shakspeare, and printed
 in 1601, among the ‘ Additional Poems to Chester⁷s Love’s Martyr.’ is a
 description of the loves of the Phcenix and the Turtle, which may vie with
 these verses of Ovid:

 ‘ So they loved, asJove in twain
 Had the essence but in one.
 Two distincts, division none;
 Number there in love was slain.
 Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
 Distance, and no space was seen
 'Twixt the turtle and his queen.’

 54. Vina-v Pharax, unica semper avim-A phanix was said to have
 made its appearance in Egypt in the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus (Anna). vi.
 28) says of this singular and solitary bird (unica) = ⁴ Sacrum noli id animal,
 et ore ac distinctn pennarum a ceteris avibus diversum consentinnt, qui
 formam ejus deﬁniere.’ It appeared once only in a cycle of ﬁve hundred
 years (Herodotus, ii. 73). Lactantius, in his poem De Phanice, thuspor-
 trays it, terming it, as Ovid does, ‘ unica Phoenix :’ ““

 ⁴ Albicat insignia misto viridante smaragdo;
 Rt puro cornu gemmea cuspis hiat.
 Ingentes oculis: credas geminos hyscinthos:
 Quorum de medio lucida ﬂamma micat.
 AEquntur toto capiti radiata corona.
 thbei referem verticis alta decus.
 Crura tegunt squamae ﬂavo distincta metallo:
 Ast ungues roseus pingit honore color.’

 Clandian also wrote a poem on the Phcenix. Its eﬂigy appears on the
 Egyptian monuments, where it has the head of an eagle and human hands.
 The feathers are yellow, green, and blue; the crest red, and a star appears
 beside the bird. The Phoenix is the emblem of a solar cycle of ﬁve hundred
 or ﬁve hundred and sixty years.

 Ovid’s wife was born was Falerii, now Cim‘Ia Castellum, and its inhap
 bitants were Falisci, a Pelasgian race under an Etruscan government. It
 is probable that Camillus did not take the place, since we ﬁnd it long after-
 wards at war with Rome; nor was it completely reduced until after the
 ﬁrst Punic war (Livy, Epist. xix.; Zonsr. viii. 18). The well-known story
 of the traitorous schoolmaster and the generous behaviour of Camillus,

 the Pelasgi were the common basis of both Greek and Italian population.
 Juno, we know indeed, was worshipped at Veii. Livy, v. 21 = ‘ Edes J uno-

 62. Calva-C. Licinius Macer Calvus was one of the most remarkable
 men of the last age of the Roman commonwealth, since he was equally
 distinguished for his eloquence and poetical talents. As an orator be
 ranked, in contemporary estimation, with Caesar, Brutus, Pollio, and
 Messalam as a poet with Catullus. He wrote short poems of a light and
 sportive character; Elegies, one of which, on the death of_ his mistress
 Quintilia, was warmly extolled at the time; and ﬁerce lampoons upon
 Pompeius, Cmar, and the principal political persons of his day. Horace
 sneers at him (Sat. i. 10. 19: ‘Nil printer Calvum et doctus cantare
 Catullum ’), perhaps from envy. From the notices of him by Pliny (Epist.
 i. 16) and Aulus Gellius (xix. 9), we may infer that although Calvus wrote
 with vigour, his versiﬁcation was harsh and his expressions void of the
 polish of the Augustan age.

 64. Galle.-C. Cornelius Gallus was equally celebrated for his military
 and poetical talents; the one raised him to the prefecture of Egypt, after
 the {all of Antonius and Cleopatra in B.c. 29: the other procured him the
 friendship of Asinius Pollio, Varus, Virgil, and Ovid. Gallus committed
 suicide in 5.0. 26. He had given offence to Augustus, though its precise

 nature is unknown. He is supposed to have exceeded his powers in
 Egypt, and to have spoken arrogantly of his own deserts, and of Caesar‘s
 obligations to him. Ovid, Trist. ii. 446: ‘Linguam nimio non tenuisse
 mero.’ His elegies, none of which have been preserved, were highly
 esteemed by the contemporaries of Gallus (id. ib. iv. 30. 53), and his
 death excited general sorrow.

 Annus AETAs. The number of ages through which mankind passed
 from a perfect to their present imperfect condition is variously stated by
 the ancient poets. Hesiod (0p. et Dies, 109-208) makes them ﬁve;
 Ovid, omitting the Heroic Age, four; Aratus (Phaanom. 100-134) three;
 Virgil (Georg. i. 125; comp. Eneid, viii. 314) and Tibullus (Eleg.
 3'. 35) two only. All looked forward on the expiration of the lron Age,
 ἰ. e. the present condition of the world, to a restoration of mankind to
 primitive innocence and happiness. Ovid, in his description of them, fol-
 lows Hesiod and Virgil. Seneca, or the play-writer who assumes his name,
 copies Ovid.

 91. Sorores . . ,patri-The nymphs are called the sisters of Narcissus,
 and he their brother, because he was the son of a nymph, Liriope, of
 Thespiae.

 95. Croceum pro ’empore florem-The narcissus grows abundantly
 about Mount Helicon, the scene of Narcissus’s transformation. The
 Greek word is probably derived from the Persian Ns'rgis. It was sacred
 to Demeter and Kora (Sophocl. Edip. Colon. 682).

 Of this legend. so beautifully narrated by Ovid, there are other forms :

 l. Among the lovers of Narcissus was a youth named Ameinias, who
 slew himself at the door of Narcissus’s house, and called upon the gods
 to avenge his death. Narcissus, tormented by self-love and by repent-
 ance, put an end to his life, and from his blood there sprang up the ﬂower
 that bears his name.

 2. Another account stated that he had a beloved twin-sister, his express
 image, and that after her death he gazed on his own features reﬂected in
 a well, to satisfy his longing for the deceased.

 3. Α third story was that be melted away into the well where he had
 beheld his own image. This was rationalized into drowning himself
 in the well (Eustathips ad Homer. p. 266). Many legends were in-
 .vented to account for the origin of ﬂowers. Thus, from the blood of
 Ajax Telamon there sprang up a purple ﬂower which bore on its leaves
 the letters αἵ, at once the initials of his name and expressive of a sigh.
 The blood of Adonis became a rose; the tears of Aphrodite for his death
 an anemone. Bion (Epitaph. Adonidos, 65).

 Scum Douos. Spenser’s description of ‘ The House of Sleep’ is more
 ﬁnished than Ovid’s, but, as will be seen, is under some obligations to it:

 ‘ He, making speedy waye through sperséd ayre,
 And through the world of waters wide and deepe,
 To Morpheus’ house doth hastily repaire.
 Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe
 And low, where dawning daye doth never peeps,
 His dwelling is. There Tethys his wet bed
 Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe
 In silver dews his ever-drooping hed,

 Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.

 ‘ Whose double gates he ﬁndeth looked fast,
 The one fayre framed of burnisht yvory,
 The other all with silver overcast:

 212 NOTES 0N

 And wakeful dogges before them farre do lye,

 Watching to banish Care, their enimy,

 Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.

 By them the sprite doth passe in quietly,

 And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe
 In drowsie lit he ﬁnden: of nothing he takes kepe.

 ‘ And more to lulla him in his slumber soft,
 A trickling streame from high rock tumbling downe
 And ever‹drizzling ruine upon the loft,
 Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the nonne
 Of swarming bees, did cast him in a swowne.
 No other noyse, nor peoples’ troublous cryes,
 As still are wont t’annoy the walled towne,
 Might there be heard; but careless Quiet lyes
 Wrapt in eternal silence, farre from enimyea.’

 1. Cimmerios.— The Cimmerii in Homer (Odyss. xi. 13 foll.) dwell
 beyond the Ocean, is. on the further side of the great river which enfolds
 the earth. Some of Ovid’s description of their land of darkness and mist
 is borrowed from the Odyssey:

 ’Ἔνθα δὲ Κιμμερίων ἀνδρῶν δῆμός τε πόλις τε,

 Ἦέρι καὶ νεφέλῃ κεκαλυμμένοι· οὐδέ ποτ’ αὐτοὺς
 Ἠέλιος φαέθων ἐπιδέρκεται ἀκτίνεσσιν,

 060' ὁπότ’ ἂν στείχῃσι πρὸς οὐρανὸν ὰστεροέντιι,
 0W ὅταν ἂψ ἐπὶ γαῖαν ἀπ’ οὐρανόθεν προτράπηται.

 The ‘Cimmerium domus’ is described by Valerius Flaccus, Argonaut. iii.
 398. The Cimmerians were an historical as well as a mythic race. They
 once were the chief occupants of the Tauric Chersonesus (Crimea). On
 this peninsula was the Κύμη Κιμμερικὴ mentioned by Strabo (xi. 2, p.
 402) as the point from which vessels that entered the Sea of Azof laid
 their course for the markets at the mouth of the Tanais. Herodotus
 (iv. 12) mentions, as still remaining in his time, the tombs of Cimmerian
 kings near the Tyras (Dniester), and several places in the Scythian
 country.

 5. Dubize lucis.—‘ Light much like a Ihade.’-—Ales. The cock. Lucian
 (Verte Histor. ii. 31, p. 29, ed. Biporit.) assigns the cock (Ἀλεκτρύων) a
 temple in the city of Somnus: it is in the midst of a wood of poppy
 and mandragora-trees (μηκῶνες ὑψηλαὶ καὶ μανδραγόραι), tenanted by
 innumerable bats (πολύ τι πλῆθος νυκτερίδων).-Βοῐὶἱι·ἰίέυε canes. ⁴ Wake-
 ful dogges’ in Spenser, Lc. Livy. v. 47 : ‘ Canes sollicitum ad uocturnos
 strepitus animal.⁷-Amer. Though the dogs slept, the geese in the capitol
 discerned the approach of the Gaula. Comp. Metamorph. viii. 684:
 ‘Unicus anser erat, minimae custodia villae.’ See Columella, R. R.
 viii. 13.

 12. Lethen-In sleep men forget their cares; that river is accordingly
 the stream appropriate to the House of Sleep. Virgil (Georg. i. 87) calls
 Somnus Lethceus. In the Hymns of Orpheus, 84, 8, Somnus is the
 brother of Lethe. Callimachus (Del. 324) ascribes to Somnus a sleep-
 drenched wing, ληθαῒον πτερόν.

 15L Saporem-The dew of slumber. Dryden’s translation of ‘The
 House of Sleep’ is excellent:

 ovm. 213

 ‘ Iris from the steep
 Descends to search the silent House of Sleep.

 'Near the Cimmerium, in his dark abode,
 Deep in a cavern, dwells the drowsy god:
 Whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun,

 Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome noon:
 But lazy vapours round the region ﬂy,
 Perpetual twilight, and a doubtful sky :

 No crowing cock does there his wings display,
 Nor with his horny bill provoke the day :

 Nor watchful dogs, nor the more wakeful geese
 Disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace :
 Nor beast of nature, nor the tame, are nigh,
 Nor trees with tempests rocked, nor human cry;
 But safe repose, without an air of breath
 Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death.

 ‘ An arm of Lethe, with a gentle ﬂow
 Arising upwards from the rock below,

 The palace meats, and o’er the pebbles creeps
 And with soft murmurs calls the gentle sleeps ;
 Around its entry nodding poppies grow,

 And all cool simples that sweet rest bestow.
 Night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains,
 And passing sheds it on the silent plains.

 No door there was the unguarded house to keep,
 On creaking hinges turned, to break his sleep.

 ‘ But in the gloomy court was raised a bed.
 Stuffed with black plumes, and on an ebon stead.
 Black was the covering too, where lay the god,
 And slept supine, his limbs displayed abroad.
 About his head fantastic visions ﬂy,

 Which various images of things supply,
 And mock their forms: the leaves on trees not more,
 Nor bearded ears in ﬁelds, nor sands upon the shore.’

 Bancrs m* Pmuuox. The imaginary reciter of this story is Lelex,

 ⁸ An old, experienced man.
 Who thus with sober gravity began’ (Dryden),

 in reply to the impious doubts of Pirithous, son of Ixion, who had denied
 the power of the gods to work miracles. Ovid is supposed to have bor-
 rowed freely in this poem from the ‘ Hecale ’ of Callimachus, now lost;
 for she, like Baucis, was a very old and very hospitable woman. See
 Plutarch, Theseus, c. 14. After death Hecale was worshipped in Attica,
 διὰ τὸ ξενία-ιιι Θησέα. The story of ‘ Hyrieus’ (Fast. v. 499) is very similar
 to that of ‘ Baucis and Philemon.’

 5. Pittheus was son of Pelops, Pelops of Tantalus, king of Phrygia.—-
 Quondam reynata. Pelops was expelled from Sipylus, in Phrygia, by
 Ilus (Pausanias. ii. 22, § 4), and settled at Pisa, in Elis. The great
 southern peninsula of Greece, Peloponnesus, derived its name from him.

 For ﬂoor of earth a marble floor behold;

 94. Vota ﬁdea sequitur.
 ’ ⁴ The wish, as soon as uttered, was fulﬁlled.’

 97. Inciperent, sie. ‘ narrare sicut aeditui templi.¹
 102-107. The closing lines are thus rendered by Dryden :

 ‘ E’en yet an ancient Tyanean shows
 A spreading oak that near a linden grows;
 The neighbourhood conﬁrm the prodigy,
 Grave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie.
 I saw myself the garlands on their boughs,
 And tablets hung for gifts of granted vows;
 And offering fresher up, with pious prayer,
 “The good,” said I, “ are God’s peculiar care,
 And such as honour heaven shall heavenly honour share."’

 Manna. The rhetorical, indeed the dramatical, vigour of this soliloquy
 of Medea’s, might lead us to the opinion that Ovid, had he curbed instead
 of indulging his fancy, would have succeeded as a tragic or epic writer,
 and that, in the Coutentio, Tragmdin was right in endeavouring to enlist
 him under her banners. It might be said of him, as of a contemporary
 poet: ‘ Tanta illi erat velocitas orationis, ut vitium ﬁeret. Itaque D. Au-
 gustus optime dixit, “Aterius noster suﬁamiuaudus est.”' (Seneca, Exc.
 Controv. 4, pref.) It is interesting to see Medea in the character of a
 loving and selﬂsacriﬁcing maiden, as yet unsoiled by crime, and unembit-
 tered by remorse. She has become, in Greek, Latin, and Italian dramas.
 and even in Ovid’s heroic epistle (Heroid. xii.), a stage virago, inspiring
 some pity, but much more terror. Valerius Flaccua, in his ‘ Argonautica,’
 has infused into his Medea some of the tenderness and self-devotion por-
 trayed by Ovid; but less effectively, because he is so much more of the
 rhetorician than the poet.

 7. Modo denique.-Modo, at this instant. ‘Denique modo’ is a very
 unusual combination : it seems to imply that Medea was now entering on

 ‘omnino,’ ‘in short.’

 AJAcrs ET ULYssrs Cowman-no. The certamen armorum, between 1
 Ajax and Ulysses, for the armour of Achilles, was a very favourite subject ἶ

 with ancient poets and rhetoricians. The ﬁrst mention of the dispute is

 in Odyssey, xi. 542, and the memory of it was long preserved among the ἶ
 AEolian race (Pausanias, Attic. p. 86). The ‘ Ethiopis’ of Arctinus closed q
 with this contention, and it is recorded in the ‘ Lesser Iliad’ of Lesches. ,
 Eschylus wrote a play on the Ὄπλων Κρισίς; and in Latin there were ‘

 tragedies by Pacuvius and Attius on the same theme. Timsnthes and
 Parrhasius painted the scene of strife, and as the picture of the former
 proved to be the favourite, Parrhasius, in the character of Ajax. remarked,
 ‘Se moleste ferre quod iterum ab indigne victus esset’ (Pliny, N. H.
 xxxv. 10, § 72). There are also two deelamations on the subject, one as-
 scribed to Ajax, the other to Ulysses, among the works of the rhetorician An-

 tisthenes. (Reiske, Orat. Graze. vol. viii.) Next to Ovid’s,however, the most ,

 full description extant of the strife is that in the ⁴ Post-Homerica’ of Quin-

 tus Smyrnaaus (v. 180-316). To some of these sources Ovid is doubtless ’

 indebted; but he has made the story his own by the eloquence, vigour,

 ovm. 217

 and dignity, with which he has handled it. The principal coincidences
 between the Latin poet and his precursors will be pointed out.
 1. Comma—Ovid omits one picturesque circumstance. Quintus says
 (v- 17 7) that in the ¹ circle '
 Τρώων ἐρικυδέες υἷες
 VECov-r’ ἐν μέσσοισι, δορύκτητοί περ ἐόντες
 'Ozppa θέμιν καὶ νεῖκος ἀρήϊον ἷθύνωσιν.

 There is a magnanimity in thus admitting captives as arbiters, worthy of
 a chivalrous legend.

 3. Ut=utpole qui-Cicero, Pro Rose. Amer. l7: ‘ Homo, ut erat fu—
 riosus, respondet.’—Impatiem ime. Μέγ’ἆσχαλόων, Quint. Smyr. v. 180.

 placed. It is the modern Yenislceri.

 The cause of the feud of Ulysses with Palameden is ascribed by some

 He possessed horses white as the snow and rapid as the winds oi his

 drank of the rivers of the Troad,—the Simois or Scamsnder,—Troy could
 not be taken. Ulysses and Diomeden carried oﬂ’ the horse· by night, and
 murdered Rhesus in his sleep. The story is related in the tenth book of
 the Iliad, and formed the subject of a tragedy, ascribed to Euripides.
 Dolon, son of Eumedes, was a Trojan, son of the herald Eumedes. On
 condition of receiving the horses and chariot of Achilles, he undertook to
 play the spy in the Grecian camp. (Iliad; Euripides, ib.) He is called
 imbellis, because his principal quality was swiftness of foot.

 Ὃς δή τοι εἶδος μὲν ἔην κακὸς, ἀλλὰ ποδώκης.

 Virgil (Eneid, xii. 346) makes Dolon a present of valeam-Helenum. See

 Nor let my wit and.wonted eloquence,

 To bear against myself, and deemed a fault.

 For every man may freely use his own.’ (Dryden.)

 Peleus, and his brother Telamon, are said to have murdered their step-
 brother Phocus, and to have been condemned and banished for their
 cnme.

 146. Cyllem'us.—Hermea was the father of Autolycus, whose daughter
 Anticleia was the mother of Ulysses by Laertes, king of Ithaca. This
 assertion of ‘ nobilitas’ is the rejoinder to the taunt of Ajax, v. 31.

 155. Peleus was king of a portion of Phthie in Thessaly; Pyrrhus was
 born in Scyros, an island in the group of Sporades; Teucer, a son of
 Telamon, was half-brother of Ajax, and the best archer among the Greeks
 at Tro .

 162.y Genetrix· Nere't'a.——'l‘hetis, the sea-nymph, daughter of Nereus and
 mother of Achilles, foreknowing that if her son went to 'l‘roy he must
 perish in the prime of manhood, hid him, in female attire, among
 the daughters of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, one of whom, Deidameia,
 became the mother of Pyrrhus.

 171. Telephon . . . domui . . . reheb-Telephus was another of the heroes
 on whom the fall of Troy was contingent. Wounded by Achilles, an oracle
 declared that he alone who had hurt could heal him. Ulysses here claims
 the credit of reconciling Telephus with Achilles, by the rust of whose
 spear his wound was cured. Quintus Smyrnwus (v. 256) puts a similar
 argument in Ulysses’s mouth:

 Καὶ δ’ αὐτὸν Πηλῆος ἐϋσθενέα κλυτὸν υἷα
 Ἤγαγον Ἀτρείδῃσιν ἐπίῤῥοθον · ἢν δὲ Kai'ﬁhhou

 ledges his danger on that night: μεμνήμεθ’ ἐς κίνδυνον ἐλθόντες μέγαν.

 What said this hoaster then? why not one word,
 But gaping sat, while shrill Thersites railed
 Upon the kings. ’Twas I the hunchback quailed,
 And raised the drooping courage of the host.’

 244. Dolona-Dolon came to the Grecian lines on a similar errand to
 that which took Diomedes and Ulysses to the Trojan bivouac, viz. to
 collect what news he might of their plans for the morrow.

 252. Curru.-This is a Roman addition to the story of the Iliad. The
 two chiefs drove off only the horses of Rhesum-Cujus equos, the horses
 of Achilles, which were promised to Dolon if he brought to Hector intel-
 ligence of the Grecian plans.

 279. Vulnere nullae-Here is another deviation from the facts of the
 Iliad. Ajax wounded Hector with his spear ‘ athwart his neck, and blood
 was seen to start,’ and immediawa after knocked him over with a huge
 stone. In all his speech, indeed, Ulysses claims the full privilege of an
 advocate, and often, like Coriolanus in Shakespeare, asserts: ‘ Alone I did
 it, I.’

 284. Hie humera-Quintus (iii. 384) says, that many chieﬂains bore
 oﬂ' to the tents the dead body of Achilles, but in v. 286, Ulysses, as in
 Ovid, claims the deed for himself: ἐσάωσα δ’ ὁμῶς τεύχεσσι θανόντα. In
 Antisthenes (p. 53) Ajax rescues the corpse, Ulysses the armour.

 daughter of Atreus, and in the ‘ Post-Homerica’ was one of the most dis-
 tinguished persons in the'l‘rojan story. Homer does not mention him. and
 he is supposed to have been ﬁrst celebrated by Stasinus, in the ‘ Cypria.’
 Palamedes became a favourite character with, the tragic poets and the
 Sophists, who ascribe to him the invention of light-houses, measures.
 scales, discus, dice, the art of posting sentinels, and even of the alphabet.
 He was condemned to death for corresponding with Priam ; but it is said
 that Diomedes and Ulysses forged the evidence on which he was convicted,
 and found in his tent the letter which they had themselves composed and
 concealed there (Schol. ad Euripid. Orest. 422). Some attributed this
 device to Ulysses alone (Xenophon Memorab. iv. 2, § 23; Apolog. § 26).

 DE JAN! Bxcnrrls ORIGIN]! m· Cunw. Janus, the Deivos Janos of
 the Salian Hymns, is the sun, and brother of the Deiva Jana, or Diana, the
 moon. He was a more ancient deity in Italian worship than even Jupiter
 himself, and in the public prayers his name took precedence. He was
 ‘ quadrifrons,’ as well as ‘ biceps’ and ‘ biformis' (Servius ad lEneid. vii.
 607). Mr. Keightley (Mythology, 2nd ed. p. 521), and the article ‘Janusl
 in Dr. Smith’s Dictionary, give an account of all the functions of this
 deity and most of the theories respecting his origin and meaning.

 2. Nullum Graecia mameae-Indian mythology, however, has a deity, ‘

 ‘ Ganesa,’ similar in many particulars to the Italian Janus.

 5. Tabellis.—-Writing-tables. Sudden brilliance announced the presence
 of a god. Comp. lEneid, iii. 151 z ⁶ multo manifesti lumine.⁷

 ll. Baculum flavumque-The staff and hey are symbols of his power
 over the entrance of heaven: hence be bore the surnames of Patulcius
 (patere), the opener (40), and of Clusius (claudere). the closer (41).—
 Ore priore, his front face.—— Votes operante dierum. Poet engaged on the
 history of days,—the calendar.

 15. Me chaos . . . deo (24).—Janus, originally Chaos, ‘ confusion,’ be-
 comes Cosmos, ‘ order,’ 17-22.

 26. Ante . . . poth-This line expresses the perpetuity of Janus,—‘ res
 est prisca,’ he beholds all the past; ‘ res est nova,’ he looks over the pre.
 sent to the future.

 30. He is the Janitor, or door-keeper, of heaven and earth.

 32. Cardiuis.——At the cardinal points there were, in the poetic and
 popular creed of Ovid’s time, doors for the gods to enter and depart from
 heaven. The entrance to the abode of the gods on Mount Olympus was
 closed by a gate of clouds kept by the seasons (Iliad, v. 749; viii. 393);
 but its valves opened spontaneously for the ingress or egress of the greater
 gods. Statius (Thebaid, i. 157) enumerates the cardiac: caeli.-

 ⁴ Limes uterque poli quem Sol emissus Eoo

 69. Iynota, the stragem-lacteum opus, her nest wrought of mud.

 76. After the winter solstice (Bruma) the days begin to lengthen.

 77. Port ea nimbum-danus was the god of the beginning of every-
 thing,—Chaos, Cosmos, the year, human life, etc. As the kalends, or ﬁrst
 day of each month were sacred to Juno, Janus was called Junonius ; and
 as he presided over the opening hour of each day, Matutinus Pater. His
 peculiar festival was New-Year’s day, when, inasmuch as every beginning
 was thought ominous of the end of a work, people were careful in all
 they said, thought, and did. On that day they abstained from evil words,
 greeted one another in terms of favourable import, put on new or holiday
 attire, exchanged gifts (siren,- French (Irma), and performed a part
 of whatsoever they purposed doing in the course of the year (Columella,
 R. R. xi. 2; Seneca, Epist. 83).

 81. Delibet.———Just skims the surface. ‘ Leviter attingit;’ but his work
 plight day is symbolic only (auspicandi gratia); he does not persist in

 a ur.

 83. Numina placem-To whatever god a Roman sacriﬁced, he ﬁrst
 oﬁ'ered frankincense and wine to Janus, either because Janus built the
 ﬁrst temple (Macrob. Saturnal. i. 9), or because he ﬁrst taught men the
 use of wine and far (spelt) in sacriﬁce.

 93. Caducae.—Prayers that {all to the ground—unavailing.

 97. Quid vult-The presents interchanged on the ﬁrst of January were
 sweetmeats, gilt dates (palma), ﬁgs (carica, ἰσχὰς), honey-cakes, and
 copper coins (stipir), having on the obverse the double head of Janus, on
 the reverse a ship. See Suetonius, August. 91.

 109. Priscs' temporit, the good old times.

 111. Martiyenam Quirinum-Romulus, son of Mars, who, after death,
 became the god Quirinus. ‘

 113. Vix totum-Nor was there a standing ﬁgure of Jupiter: the low-
 roofed temple would not admit of one.

 114. Edda—Made of baked clay, terra cottL—Lenis lumina. Even
 so small a quantity of silver as a thin plate of it was regarded as a breach
 of frugality. In 5.0. 275, P. Cornelius R'uﬁnus was expelled from the ,
 senate by the censors, {or having in his possession ten pounds of silver
 plate.

 121. Fortuna-A certain fatality, for good or evil, was supposed to
 belong to nations. Plutarch wrote a treatise on the Fortune of Alexander ‘
 the Great, another on the Fortune of the Roman people. At Rome there
 were two temples to Fortune. the one called Bona or Virgo Fortune, the
 other, Fors Fortune. Both were ascribed to Servius Tullius. At Vulsinii
 in Etruria she was worshipped under the name of Nortia, and had temples
 at Antium, Pmneste, and elsewhere. ,

 123. Cream»! et opem-Sallust (Until. 12) draws a very similar pic- ‘
 ture of the Roman lust of gold: ‘ Postquam divitie honori esse empore, et

 ovm. 225

 eas gloria, imperium, potentia sequehantur: hebescere virtus, paupertas
 probro haberi,innocentia pro malevolentia duci coepit,’ etc.; and Mr. Me-
 rivale (Hist. of Rome, vol. i. ch. 2) describes the coarse uses to which the
 Romans put their wealth.

 ‘ From greed to waste, from waste to greed they range,
 And vices thrive and batten upon change.
 Honour is valued by its market-rate:
 Be rich, and men will hail you good and great.
 As is your income, so your friends and fame:
 To be a poor man is the only shame.’

 132. Prisca monam-The earliest Roman cuins were of Es, a com-
 position of metals in which copper was the principal ingredient. Silver
 was ﬁrst coined in n.c. 269, ﬁve years before the ﬁrst Punic war: gold was
 not coined until sixty-two years later (Pliny, N. H. xxxiii. 13).

 137. Manitu: is the accusative plural of the substantive.

 139. Natalia—The ﬁrst coinage was attributed to Janus or Saturn. On
 the obverse was the two-headed god (biceps), on the reverse a ship.

 143. fla-scum in amnem, the Tiber.—Falm_'fer dem, Saturn (AEneid, viii.
 319 £011.). His statues bore a sickle, the emblem of agriculture. Cicero
 derives his name ‘a satu’ (Nat. Deor. ii. 25; Varro, L. L. iv. 64), and
 at Rome the treasury was in his temple, for agriculture is the source of
 wealth (Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. 42; Keightley, Anc. Mythol. p. 523).

 149. Bona puntentur-Succeediug times, cherishing his memory, be-
 cause Saturn had taught them to sow corn, plant vines, and given them
 laws.

 151. Laevum latum-See 157. The Janiculum, on the Tuscan bank of
 the Tiber.—Arenosi. Comp. Eneid, vii. 31 z ‘ Vorticibus rapidis et multa
 ﬂavus arena.’ From the quantity of sand washed down its stream, flavus
 is the constant epithet of this river.—Placidissima unda. The current up
 the Tiber sets strongest on the right or Latin bank ι, hence the left bank
 is less affected by the stream, and the wave is the gentler on that side.-—-
 Cults-is, the inhabitants-Ianiculum. The J aniculum begins at that point
 opposite the Campus Martins where the Tiber reaches farthest to the
 west, whence it stretches in a southerly direction to a point opposite the
 Aventine.

 159. Nondum Justitiam-Comp. Metamorph. i. 150:

 ‘ Ultima ccelestum, terras Astra-.3. reliquit.’

 161. Pudor.—-Self-respect. Comp. Hesiod, Op. et Dies, 195-199.

 167. Quum tot sint Iani-«There were at least three temples of Janus
 in Rome: Templum Jani Quirini in the Forum; Jani Gemini in the Argi.
 letum, a street leading from the Vicus Tuscus to the Tiber: and a third
 whose site is unknown. Jani are properly arches, (διὰ) ‘ a thoroughfare,’
 as Mr. Keightley says (in his note ad loan), ‘like that of Temple-bar, in
 London, under which people passed from one street to another. They
 were always double, people entering by one and going out by the other,
 every one keeping to the right.’ There appear to have been three arches
 dedicated to Janus in the Forum, one at each end, and a third in the
 centre, near to the Arcus Fabianus at the extremity of the Sacred Way.
 (Comp. Horace, Sat. 3. 18; Epist. i. l. 54.)—Slas sacratus. ‘Why

 have you a statue in only one of the three?’—— Fan's duobus. the ox-
 market and the ﬁsh-market.—-1Ebalis'. The Sabines were supposed to be a
 Laconian colony. AEbalius was an ancient king of Laeedaemon.

 184. Tuto . . . loom—The hot stream sank down again: the ground
 resumed its former aspect—Puree sat-9110. Procopius (Bell. Goth. i. 25)
 says that this ‘ sacellum ’ was a small square ediﬁce of bronze, containing
 a statue of Janus, placed in front of the Curia, a little above the chapel
 of the Tria Fata.

 195. Pacis mirmiram-The Emperor Tiberius and his adopted son
 Germanicus Caesar. The allusion is to the triumph of the latter ‘de
 Chattis, Cheruscis, et Angrivariis,’ an). 16. two years before Ovid’s death.
 These lines were therefore written at Tomi, and appended to the original
 draft of the Fasti.

 196. Deserat auctor opus.--Abandon his own good work by going to

 war again.

 ANNA: PIBINNE Fas'ruu. “ To Anna Perenna, ‘the ever-circling
 moon,’ the ancients dedicated the ldes of March (15th), the ﬁrst full
 moon of the primitive year. The idea therefore attached to her name
 was that of a regular ﬂowing, of a constant recurrence; and damus (annus),
 god of the sun, and anna, goddess of the moon, denotes at once ¹ the ever.

 ﬂowing ’ (ὢέ-ναοε), and ‘the ever-recurring’ (ἀεὶ urinates)" (Donaldson’s
 “ ‘Varronianus,’ p. 216, 2nd ed.)

 Hanna, or Anna, was a Hebrew, and, doubtless, also a Tyrian name
 (l Sam. i. 2). Anna, the sister of Dido, is therefore of Oriental origin,
 and wholly diﬂ’erent from Anna Perenna, the Italian goddess, whose name
 is connected with .éEneas (Macrob. Saturn. i. 12, § 6). ,

 Some legend: make Anna, and not her sister Dido, the mistress of ’
 Einen (Servins ad (Eneid. iv. 682; ib. v. 4), and as having slain herself on
 the funeral pile on his account. (Sir G. G. Lewis, ‘Credibility of Early
 Rom. History,’ vol. i.)

 1. Idibus.-“ Idus is the division of the month. Varro, L. L. vi. ξ 28:
 ‘ Idus ab eo quod Tuscis ihn.’ Comp. Macrob. Saturn. i. 15. As itus was
 the διχομηνία of the Tuscan lunar month, its connection with the root id,
 or ﬁd, is obvious. Comp. di-vido, vid-uus, etc. [iduare=dividere]. So
 Horace (Car-m. iv. 11. 14):

 “ ‘ Idus tibi sunt agenda,
 Qui dies mensem Veneris marinas
 Findit Aprilem.’ "
 (Donaldson, ‘Varronianus,’ p. 158.)

 Festum geniale. ‘Dies quo genio indulgetur;' a day of mirth and social
 enjoyment. The month of December is called by Ovid (Fast. iii. 58)
 ‘acceptus geniis,’ because of the indulgence of the Saturnalia (Virgil,
 Geor . i. 300 . -

 2. gHamiplocuL—The sacred grove wherein this feast was celebrated. ,

  

 ‘Anme pomiferum nemus Perennae’ (Martial, Epigramm. iv. 64. 17), is i
 supposed to have been near the ﬁrst milestone on the Flaminian road, g
 and not far from the present'Porta Pia, between the road and the Tiber. 1

 -Advena Tibri. See note on Propertius, El. vii. p. 175. J
 duf;bm'Jwe.—‘ Sub dio,’ in the open air. Fast. ii. 299: ‘Sub Jove I

 own. 227

 7. Calumet—Bundles or sheaves of stram-Cyanam. ⁸ Saucers of wine.’
 They drink according to the number of years for which they pray.—Neuoria
 eb. annos. Some drain aa many cups as Nestor is said to have lived years.
 —Sibylla. A hundred years were allotted at least to these old prophetesses.
 Observe qui and quo, ‘there you may ﬁnd a man, there also a woman.’

 14. Emilee—Ready to applaud their own- imitations of the songs
 they have caught up at the theatres.—Jactant, beat time and gesticulate.
 -Posito cratere, putting the bowl down on the ground they dance round
 it.—-Duras, their imitations of the dances are as rude as those of the
 sougs.-Culta. spruce, smart.——Fortuaatoe, they who meet the revellers
 returning home bade them ‘ good luck.’

 20. ‘ Every story has its place in my plan.⁹-Araerat. Observe the play
 on the word; on ique, the metaphorical ﬂame, on royia, the ﬁre of the
 pile.

 25. A repetition from the epistle of Dido to Einen, 194-6:

 ‘ Hoe tamen in tumuli marmore carmen erit:
 “ Praebuit Eneas, etc." '

 27. Sine vindice regnum-The undefended realm of Carthage. Its
 queen was dead; ‚Eneu was in Italy. Iarbas, before the arrival of the
 Trojans, had _been an unsuccessful suitor of Dido's. ‘Zelotypus Iarbaa,’
 Juvenal, Satir. v. 45.

 32. Apes—Comp. Virgil, Georg. iv. 213.

 33. Tertia area . . . tertia muten—J Thrim had the eoru been garnered,
 thrice the wine-vats ﬁlled,’ counting years by harvests and vintages.

 36. Iudae-The rites required by custom and affection. ‘ Postquam illi,
 more regio. justa magniﬁce fecerant,’ Sallust, J ugurth. ll.—Faeill¢e. The
 ashes were quenched by oils (anyuenla) and wine. Comp. Horace,

 arm. 22:
 ‘ Ibi tu calentem
 Debita sparges lacrima favillam,
 Vatis amiei.’

 38. Vertice.-Hairs cut from the crown of the head, and laid as an

 olferius to the gods of Hades on the tomb. Comp. Eschylus, Choeph. 160:

 ‘Opo'i τομαῖον τόνδε βόστρυχον τάφῳ ·
 and Seneca, Hippolyt. 1181:

 ‘ Placemus umlms? Capitis exuvias cape,
 Laceraeque frontis accipe abscissam comam.¹

 41. Pede αμα-Δ With the braces taut.’ The pedem the ropes by
 which the yarda are moved—Van“ necundo, the vessel ran before the
 wind.

 43. Cosyrce.-—Cosyra, or Cossura, is a small island, now Pantellaria, in
 the Mediterranean sea, about halfway between Sicily and Africa. Silius
 Italicus (xiv. 272) calls it ¹ parva Cosyra,⁷ and Ovid here terms it ‘ sterilis)
 But it was thought of sufﬁcient consequence, when the Romans took it
 from Carthage in the ﬁrst Punie war, to be mentioned in the triumphs]
 Fasti; and Pantellaria is tolerably fertile in fruit and vines, for which its
 volcanic soil ia well adapted. (Smyth’a ‘ Sicily,’ p. 281.)

 228 NOTES 0N

 50. Magma qumalionis «mee-Her brother’s wrath was dreaded also
 by Dido. AEneid, iv. 43=
 ‘ Quid bella Tyro surgentia dicam
 Germanique minas ?’

 Ib. 325: ⁴ guid moi->03"? an mea Pygmalion dum moenia frater
 es rna - .

 In the hostility of Pygmalion towards Dido and Anna is perhaps im-
 plied the real enmity of the Tyrian state against its independent colony.

 57. Ummidia-The Italian Crathis derived its name from a stream in
 Achaia of the same name (Herod. i. 145). The former _was reputed to
 have the effect of turning red the hair of those who bathed in its waters
 (Strabo, vi. 263). Comp. Enripid. Troad. 224:

 Τόν τ’ ἀγχιστεύουσαν ’γᾶν
 Ἰονίῳ ναύταις πόντῳ
 *Au ὑγραίνει καλλιστεύων
 ‘O ξανθὰν χαίταν πυρσαίνων

 ‘ Crathis et huic Sybaris, nostris conterminus arvis,
 Electro similes faciunt auroque eapillos.’

 63. Subducere.—To draw up, to furl.—— Torta Iino=tortis funibus.
 73. Tum primum Dido. Comp. Silius Italicus, viii. 65:

 ¹ Ergo agitur pelago, divis inimica sibique,
 Quod se non dederit comitem in suprema sorori.’

 Any death, to ancient apprehensions, appeared preferable to drowning,
 hecause the body might lose its chance of burial. See Horace, Carm.
 l. Populos duom-His own followers, the Trojans, and the Aborigines,
 or Latins, the subjects of king Latinus. (Livy, i. 2.)

 79. Solo Achate. Comp. Silius, ib. 71:

 ⁶ ¹ Ecce autem lEneas sacro comitatus Iulo
 Jam regni compos.’
 83. Quid.-⁴ On what errand could she have come?’
 90. Tellurem-Sc. Italiam (lEneid, iv. 345), and comp. Silius, ib. 105:

 ‘ Tellurem hanc juro, vota inter nostra frequenter
 Auditum vobis.¹

 92. hermina-Camp. Eneid, iii. 148. Ä
 95. Amen—151mm, vi. 450 foll. Silius, viii. 116—156.
 103. Paratus=apparatus, amiotus. Metamorph. vi. 451;

 ‘ Magno dives Philomela paratu
 Divitior forma.’

 109. Falsum vulvum-The wound of groundless jealousy.
 113. Non habet* exactum.-¹ What to do she has not made up her mind.’

 118. Sub verbum.-⁴ While she was still speaking.’

 123. Corniger.—Rivers have this epithet because their curves resemble
 those of an animal’s horn. ‘ Corniger Tiberiu,’ Eneid, viii. 77 5 ‘ Numicius,’
 Metamorph. xiv. 602.

 128. Sustinuit . . . conscium-The Numicius, aware of the theft, could
 have revealed it, but he held his peace and ﬂowed on as usual.

 “ MACRO. 0f the poetic contemporary of Ovid to whom this letter is
 addressed an account has already been given [An Mumm Forum].

 7. ‘ Forget the seal, forget the once known hand,
 But pity still and aid your suﬁ'ering friend.’

 9. Convictibas.—Fellowship at home, companionship in travel.—Non
 aliena. Ovid⁷s third wife was g member of the Fabien family: but the
 degree of her relationship to Macer, or Macer’s wife, is unknown.

 11. Arte—Ovid sometimes ascribes his banishment to the immorality
 of his poem, the ‘ Art of Love.’ See Trist. ii. 345 =

 ‘ Haec tibi me invisum lascivia fecit, ob artes.’
 His defence was:

 Stayna Palici-The Pslicorum Lacus (Lago di Naﬂs‘a) was a small vol-
 canic lake in the interior of Sicily. Its remarkable feature is two jets of
 volcanic gas, which rise under the water, causing a violent ebullition, and
 sometimes throwing it up to a considerable height. The springs are
 strongly impregnated with naphtha and sulphur, whence Ovid terms them
 ‘ olentia.’—Cyane, the story of Cyane, one of the attendants of Proserpina,
 turned into a fountain, because of the abundant tears shed by her on the
 loss of her mistress, is told by Ovid (Metamorphos. v. 409, ete.).—
