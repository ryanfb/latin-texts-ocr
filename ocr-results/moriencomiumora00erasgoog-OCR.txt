 ’ve thought, Sir, hitherto without Succeß,

 This to deﬁre by Nature we’re inclin’d,

 Which we in our Refeatches feldom ﬁnd.
 It doth, like Beauty, in the Fancy lye, ’
 As ars· agreeable to the Lover’s Eye, ξ
 Camdion-like, from all Things' takes a· Dye.
 One thinks it doth conﬁft in ﬁnguine Mirth,
 When the Debauch to Wit mutt give a Birth =
 Anothet’s happy if Corina’s Kind ς
 The Wife Man calls it Indoleuce of Mind : ’
 The Mifer to them all prefers his Wealth;
 The jolly Liver fays ’tis ﬂorid Health: ’
 Butthele miﬂakeu Wretches go aﬁray,
 Thy Author only hath found out the Way. q
 r Like to phantattick Chymiﬁs they prefume,
 T111 all their ProjeEls break away in Fume :
 To fearch the Secret out they vainly try,
 For aﬁer all it doth in Folly lye.
 This, ’caute ’tis innocent, is the bell Eliate,"
 Which with Reﬁliancc blunts the Edge of Fate; ’
 Him with a Genius Nature doth infpire,
 Which other: by Philofophy’acquire:

 difcovcrs it by his Words: While the Wife

 Tongue; the one to fpeak what may be faid,
 the other what ought to be; the one what
 Truth, the other what the Tim requires:

 ment, as to prove that to be new White,
 which he had juit before fwore to be Black;

 telling every one thara Pious Life is the only -

 Way of fecuringa Happy Death 5 that the bea

 Title to a Pardon of our Sins is purchal'ed by ·

 a hearty Ahhorrquce of our Guilt, and 'fincere
 Refolutions of Amendment; that'the belt De-

 of their Predeceﬂbrs, with an Account of all

 are but Tranferipts of their Forefather’s dumb

 they Live net. only the molt .pleafant and un-

 There is another very pleafant Sort of Mad-

 It is almoPt needlefs to inﬁft upon the feve-

 „ -it is that the Englijh challenge the Prerogative

 tween the outward Appearance or Body of
 them, and the more inward· Soul or Spirit.
 As to lnﬁance, in Falling, they think it very
 ineffectual to abﬁain from Flelh, or debar

 the Vulgar underﬁand by this Duty,) _un—

 that the Soul being-thus Dilingaged from the l
 lntan lement of the Body, may have a better ‘
 Reli to Spiritual Objedrs, and take an Ante- ‘
 paﬂ of Heaven. Thus (fay they) in the Holy ‘
 Eucharill', tho' the outward Form and Cere- ‘
 monies are not wholly to be del'pifed, yet are
 thefe prejudicial, at leaft unproﬁtable, if as

 Ctions, that they may arife to a NeWnel's of
