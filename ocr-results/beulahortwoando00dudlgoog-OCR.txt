 PREFACE .

 My dear Lord has been pleased to guide me
 in all things in a very remarkable manner, for
 the past two and one-half years, and I feel that
 it would be'to His glory to give a few of my

 I many experiences to the public, praying that
 the Holy Spirit may make them very helpful ,
 to many in leading them into a life of perfect
 consecration, where they may be able to trust
 in the “Living God” alone, for the health and

 strength of both souland body, as well as for
 _ all blessings. Therefore, to this end I most .
 earnestly pray, you may be enabled to “lay aside
 every weight and the sin that doth so easily be-
 set you, and run with patience the race that is
 set before you, looking unto Jesus the author and
 ﬁnisher of your faith,” who heals all who are
 ready to follow His guiding voice out into His -
 vineyard where the ﬁelds are already “white for
 the harvest,” and O dearly beloved, let us “pray . ³⁶

 4
 the Lord of the harvest m sendjbrth laborers into
 the harvest,” for the time is short, and we are

 looking for the speedy coming of our glorious Δ

 Saviour and King.
 “Lo! the golden ﬁelds are smiling,
 Wherefore idle shouldst thou be;
 Great the harvest, few the reapers
 And the Lord hath needof thee."
 The proceeds of this book will be wholly
 consecrated, and used as the Lord may direct in
 extending the Gospel of Full Salvation to all;
 and my most earnest prayer to God is that a
 special Spirit Baptism may come upon every
 ' one Who shall read or purchase this book, and
 upon every one who has contributed, or shall
 contribute in any way for this branch of the
 Lord’s work.
 Mrs. Dorm G. GRIFFIN.

 NOTE.

 Some changes have come to the life of the
 author since the writing of this book while
 waiting upon the Lord for the means for its
 publication.

 V Through the plain direction of the Lord,

 Mrs. Grifﬁn has married a highly esteemed
 Christian gentleman, John H. Dudley. of Grand
 Rapids. Mr. Dudley went to “Beulah” for
 both spiritual and physical blessings, and ﬁnd-
 ing much work about the place which he could
 do, he remained from week to week until sever-
 .al months had passed. He was blessed, and
 consecrated himself to the Lord and His work.
 Mr. Dudley had been a widower more than
 thirteen years. Mrs. Grifﬁ 11's husband had
 been dead more than twenty years. It was a
 surprise when Mr. Dudley told her of his desire
 to wed. After much prayer, and feeling assur-
 ed the Lord could better use her with such a
 helper, the matter was decided. They both
 _hope to do very much more together for the

 6

 Master than it would be possible to do sepa-
 rately. Their daily prayer is that many precious
 souls may be washed in the blood of Jesus and

 be ready when He comes, through their ‘united
 efforts.

 ’ CHAPTER I.
 CONSECRATION.

 OVER two years ago, I was enabled to
 make an entire consecration of my all to Jesus,
 and feel to date my healing from that time.

 HOWever, several weeks previous to this, I
 had been seeking the blessing of bodily heal-
 ing, and a. higher Christian life, and as a means
 to this end, I laid aside all remedies, gathering
 my medicines together took them back to the
 doctor, telling him I had no further use for
 them, as I had taken Jesus for my Physician.

 While the Holy Spirit was showing me how
 much there was in me to overcome before I
 could be made ﬁt for the Master’s use this

 fore the hich
 Were days of great distress and suffering of
 body, and such dark nese, of mind thatI would,
 at times, lie on my face before the Lord, seem-

 . ingly in a God-forsaken state, yet renewing

 my vows to become anything or nothing, only
 that God Would be pleased to ﬁt me for His
 service. (I have since learned this struggling
 is unnecessary if one will take Jesus in all His
 fullness and love.) I was generally called to
 fast when there was something for dinner
 I was particularly fond οἱ, so I found it a great-
 selfdenial. I misa a meal more than most per-r
 sons, and my Father did not often call me to·
 fast more than one meal at a time; for it seem-
 ed, I could scarcely live through the day, in
 such darkness of soul and distress of body,

 Several times I wrote to Miss Judd of Buf-
 falo to prag for me, aud right here, I gratefully
 thank her (and all others who prayed for me)
 for their kind assistance and prayers. As soon
 as l could read a little I fchnd great comfort
 in reading her book, entitled the “Prayer of
 Faith,” also, “Christian‘s Secret of a. Happy
 Life,” by H. W. S. which 0. friend kindly gave
 me to read‘ But the Lord made use of the
 dear little book, “Kept for the Master's Use,”
 by Francis Havergal, in leading me to make
 an entire consecration of myself to Him, for I
 began to realize I was not my own, I was
 bought with a price, even the precious blood
 of J esus. u

 I took her poem for my own.

 “Take my life and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
 Take my hand and let them move
 At the impulse of Thy love.
 “Take my feet and let them be
 Swift mad beautiful for T1100;

 Take my voice and Let me sing ι

 Alwuys-only-for my King.
 “Take my lips and let them be

 “Take my will and make it Thine,

 This little book had been giVen me several
 years before by a Very dear friend who little
 dreamed what a power it would prove in God‘s
 hands of leading me into a life oftrust. It
 Was laid aside for years, as my eyes had been
 so bad I could not use them in reading. My
 friend, Mrs. Winchester, from Buﬁalo was visa
 iting in Grand Rapids, when she told me of
 - God’s willingness to heal the body: She also
 told me of Miss Judd's being healed, of her
 home and meetings, and gave me, "The Prayef
 of Faith," which, like "Kept for the Master’s
 Use," was laid aside, without any special atJ
 tention being, given it. Now the Lord bowed
 me my utter helplessness, and the inability of
 human physicians to bring about a perfect ogre}
 He suﬁered my business (which was our only
 daily support) to decrease, so I was not me

 · ally neededto do the little I could to assist

 in the business. I thought I might do‘ at
 little for others,- and I entered into the W. C:
 T. U. work, but soon found that every eﬁort

 only increased my suﬁering which was con-
 stant. There were, very few days I could sit
 up all day for many, many years, and never felt
 free from pain a moment, yet if I could keep
 up I called myself well. I will not here dwell
 upon the years of suffering and confinement to
 my bed and a dark room. Many thanks are
 due my dear friends and faithful physicians,
 Drs. Dolley of Albion, N. Y., and Botsford,
 (now of Grand Rapids) whose untiring efforts

 to bring relief and perfect a'cure were greatly _

 blessed of God. Dr. B. by Magnetic and Ho-
 meopathic treatment so far restored me as to
 seem almost a miracle to all who knew me.
 Many prayers were oﬁered in my behalf. I of-
 ten felt that if I knew how to take hold on Je-
 Hus I might be healed. No one showed me the
 way, so the blessing was asked upon the means.
 I partially' recovered; and recommended the
 medicine and the doctor, not speaking of the
 prayers that were uﬁered.

 There were a few years in my early womana
 hood that I seemed well, as I did not speak
 much of pain only when Ihad to give up to
 severe suﬁerm‘g which came upon me every
 two or three weeks. At that time I went out
 sewing by the day; and little did those for
 whom I worked dream of the suﬁering I was
 hiding. I was ambitions to work when Icould,
 as I needed the means and had become so ace
 customed to pain I could endure a great deal
 before yielding to it. Finally one disease after
 another seized me, until 1 had no power to re·-
 sist. During this time I was extremely nera

 say from sad personal experience, I know what

 suffering is, mental, spiritual, and physical. I “

 had many, and severe trials of my faith, and at
 times was almost overwhelmo-d. I had held to
 earthly means with such a persistence, I was

 _ just as determined to trust Jesus now, without

 any human helps. I commenced to ask God to
 speak to me through His Word, which had al-
 ways been a sealed book to me, although I had
 been a member of the Gong. Church sincoI
 was ten years of age, and had lived as most
 Christians do. I now asked the Lord to make*
 the Bible the “Lamp to my feet, and the light
 to my path.” I then commenced asking that

  

 my eyes might be strengthened, so I could see Δ -

 veriﬁed His promise to me, “Ask and yeshall

 reCeive.” I had thought if I could go to Miss
 Judd or Dr. Cullis I would be healed sooner,
 and ’I asked the Lord to open up the way if it
 were His will. Then the thought came to me,

 Jesus is everywhere present, you need not go

 From thetime I gave up amv medicines and

 healed by faith, and I was, but some days I.
 seemed and felt worse, e'fen for months after.
 But I held ﬁrmly to the Promises, repeating
 them often to myself. I “The prayer of faith

 to bed, as was ‚in such extreme suffering, __

 times holding-tvm meetings a day. Had I
 looked to my feelings, I could not have told of
 Jesus’ healing power. But 'I did not look

 within or about me, but straight up to Jesus, “

 and to His “Word,” and'by faith, the blessing
 was mine. “Hisfaith,” not mine. I learned
 to take no step, without-His guidance and in his ·
 name and strength. He always-sustained me,
 although the strength came-only step by step,
 and I had to put forth my foot to take the step
 before I realized the strength given.

 As I looked back from month to month, l-
 could see I really was a little better. My eyes ’
 were growing gradually stronger, although
 many‘times I could read but a few lines with-
 out distress, particularly in the evening. Had
 l· yielded to the enemy at this time, I should

 I wrote to Dr. Cullis, and later, to Capt.

 now, brethren I wot not that through ignor-
 ance ye did it, as did also your rulers.” Acts 8:
 16, 1-7. Only those who have tasted the power
 of Jesus and the “Word _of God,” in faith, as it
 is brought to bear on our individual experienc-
 es, really know the duties and privileges of ev-
 ery true child of God, in trusting Jesus and the ,
 power of his blood to deliver us from the pow-
 er of Satan. Let me say to those who oppose
 this glorious truth, Beware how you trample
 the blood of Jesus hnder foot, for “Of how
 much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he
 be thought worthy, who hath trodden under
 foot the'Son of God, and hath counted the
 blood of the covenant, wherewith he wus sanc-
 tiﬁed, an unholy thing, and hath done despite
 unto the spirit of grace.” And again, “The
 Lord shall judge his people.” Heb. 10:29, 30.
 For the One who upholdeth all things by the
 power of His “Word” entrusted unto us a high
 and holy calling, when He made us His believ‘
 ing disciples, and said: “And these signs shall

 follow them" that believe; in my name they
 shall cast out devils.” “They shall lay hands
 on the sick, and they shall recover;" Mark 1'6.
 for, “Himself. took our inﬂrmities and bare our
 sicknesses." Matt. 8:17.

 When -I see so many rejecting this part of I

 . the Gospel, which is so convincing to an un-

 believing world, I feel to cry, Father, forgive
 them. for they know not what they do. “Je-
 sus Christ the same, yesterday and to-day and
 forever." Heb. 13:8. “

 When I gave up my medicines, I looked
 iongingly at one remedy I used to take when
 «I felt the ﬁrst symptoms of severe and sudden
 ‘colds with which I was often attacked. This
 was usualLy a distressing combination of asth-

 ma, congestion of the lungs and rheumatism
 ’in every part of my body, any one of which

 ' caused me great suﬁering. I thought, CanI _

 give this up and trust Jesus to carry me
 through? I said, Yes, I will. Soon after this,
 I felt a cold coming on and gave myself 'anew
 into the hands of the Great Physician. I felt
 that I must not yield to.Satan‘s power, (for I
 was learning to look upon pain and suﬁering
 as from him) not even to lie down, or sit boi-v
 stered up in bed, as I could not-lie down at
 such times. I was tested for three days. and

  

 two nights, my suffering was not nearly as ’

 much as usual. Before this I would be almost
 or quite helpless from one to three Weeks.

 A friend visiting me· at this time did· not be-
 lieve much in this way, and I was very anxious
 not to dishonor the name of Jesus. I had a
 class at the Industrial School for· porrr children
 which came the third day of this attack. The
 distance was quite long, and I was ver) weak,
 but I thought for Jesus’ sake I will go, and

 trust Him for strength. Strength was given
 me to fulﬁl.my duties, but when I started for
 · home it had commenced to rain, and Satan
 _ whispered, Now you will get wet and be oblig-
 ed to call a physician after all, for you can't
 endure much more. I was always very sensi-
 tive to atmospheric changes, and damp air, and
 it seemed I could never reach home; as I
 thought over the distance l would have to go
 I felt as though I would drop on the walk. At
 once I became conscious that every breath was
 a prayer, and I ﬁnally reached home, after
 learning one of the sweetest lessons of my life,
 which was, that I did not need strength only
 for one step at a time; and when I put forth
 an’eﬁort in the name and for the glory of J e-
 sus alone, strength was always given me.
 Immediately after dinner a sleepiness came
 over me, diﬁerent from anything I had exper-
 ienced before. It seemed I was only to close
 my eyes to be sound asleep. Before this I had
 not given up to any feeling, not even to allow

 28 BEULAH.

 others to talk to me about how I fell. I only
 told Jesus; but now these words Came to me so
 sweetly; ¹⁸¹Come ye apart and rest awhile.” I
 excused myself and laid down. Before my
 friend had time to cover me I was in a sound
 sleep, and remained so the whole afternoon.
 When I awoke I was healed, and a sweet as-
 surance was given me that I never would be
 tempted with these attacks above what I was
 able to bear, and that Jesus would always
 make a way of escape. Several months after

 this I was seized with another attack and lost
 my voice, but only had to stay in one day.

 Since this I have learned to take the very ﬁrst
 symptoms to Jesus and often He removes them
 before the disease comes upon me.

 I had not been able for nearly eighteen
 years to go into the light without dark glasses, ”
 and could not remain in the light when I felt
 the best without a great increase of pain even
 with them. After claiming healing, I put on
 my glasses to go out one day, when the thought

  

 usus or FAITH. 29

 came 'to me, What would you say if anyone
 should ask you why you wore them after you
 were healed. I said, Lord, I cannot open my
 eyes for the pain without them. It seemed
 that I heard the voice of Jesus speaking to my
 heart, saying, I will lead you. Isaid, I will
 trust Thee, precious Jesus. I laid aside my
 glasses and truly He did lead me, for I could

 - not open my eyes for nearly a block; before I

 returned I had both eyes open, and uﬁered no
 more pain than usual with my glasses. The
 next time l went out l was very tired, and be.-
 ing so accustomed to take my glasses, I started
 for them. Satan whispered, You had better
 take them for you may need them. I took
 them, forgetting I had promised Jesus I would
 trust Him. Of course I needed them before
 reaching the gate. I went to the W. C. T. U.
 and the pain became so severe I had to leave
 soon after I entered. The pain increased and
 continued until I sought to learn the lesson my
 Lord would teach me. After continued asking

 30 BEULAH.

 the -thought was given me, You promised to
 trust me, and did not. I seemed to see my
 grieved Savior and Physician near. I said,
 Lord, forgive me, I will trust Thee. The next
 time I went out I started for my glasses as us-
 ual, when again I seemed to hear my Lord say:
 Child trust me to take care of your eyes. I
 said, I will, Lord Jesus. I went forth in His
 name and strength with much less pain than ,
 before, and never put them on again but once.
 [went with a company to camp out a few
 days down the river. All took their colored
 glasses, and I thought, If well people protect
 their eyes, it will be right for me. One day
 the sun was very bright on the water and they
 all put on their glasses. I put mine on alo,
 and immediately my eyes began to pain me.
 I took them 0E and said again, Jesus forgive
 me, I will trust Thee. After a little time one
 said, “Where are your glasses ?" 1 said, “Jesus
 is taking care of my eyes.” I have never used
 them since, and truly He does care for my eyes.

 ing me, Immediately I-felt the sleepy wave
 coming over me, which always comes now as a
 token of rest. This touch'of rest comes so
 unlike any other sleep. It often comes like a
 thrill passing through my whole being, and my
 eyes are so heavy with sleep I can not hold
 them open. I sometimes become unconscious
 as soon as my· eyes close, perhaps only for a
 few moments, but awaken as refreshed as
 though I had a night of sweet sleep. At this
 time, however, I slept as I did the night before,
 awaking in distress at short intervals. With
 the Lord’s help, I was able to sit up in the af-.
 ternoon, and prepare my lessons for the week.
 The old diseases, asthma, congestion of the
 lungs and rheumatism, seemed to come back
 with their former foxes. None in the house
 knew ‘what -I was suﬂering. Another night
 was passed in broken sleep and pain. I arose
 as on the previous morning, passing the fore-1
 noon the same way. My lungs were very pain-
 ful, and my breath labored and wheezy. I do

 prayer. At noon l made an eﬂort to rise and-

 away. I grew faint and deathly sick. I said,
 O my God, shall I go? I took my Bible in the
 name of Jesus, and asked Him to direct me
 through His “Word” whether I should go.-

 going. I hed three blocks at the other end of
 the route to walk, and I could only do this by
 drawing strength each step from my blessed
 Lord. I was greatly distressed ,when I reaobed
 the house, and immediately fell on my knees
 and asked those present to pray for me. Again
 .I was much relieved, and was able to partly
 eonduct .the meeting. When I returned home
 I was so much better that I almost forgot my
 distress. Next morning I was very weak and
 -my lungs sore end cough bad, so it was very
 diﬂicult for me to to talk. The pain had nearly
 left -my body but it was sore und lame when I
 moved. Quite early· a gentlemen and wife
 called-to talk with me, and-learn more of this
 way of faith. Strength was given me to talk
 with them most of the day, and as a result of
 this day’s-work, I have many times heard him
 speak of the great blessing which (some to their
 lives, and to the wholefamily.

 God in your body and in your spirit, which

 ever think Jesus had purchased your body,
 whether in sickness or in health, you are not
 your own; you are bought with the blood of

 the Son of God, and your-body is the temple of
 the Holy Ghost. 1 Cor. 3237. Did you ever
 take any medicine that injured you? I have
 heard physicians say that more deaths were
 caused by medicines than by disease. Jesus,
 my Physician, never makes any mistake, never
 experiments. You can trust Him, for He has
 paid a great price for your whole being, which
 constitutes your spirit, soul and body, and can-
 not be separated in this life. Oh, do not deﬁle
 your body any longer with poisonous drugs
 and medicines, but put yourself into Jesus'
 hands and trust Him to make you Whole. '

  

 CHAPTER III.
 THE LEADINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

 ' ONE evening, in the early part of my ex·
 perience, as I sat reading in the Bible, I was
 very happy. The spirit of prayer came over
 me, and I retired to my room and had asweet
 talk with Jesus. I seemed almost to be carried
 to the “third Heaven.” I asked Jesus that my
 sins might be all washed away. Immediately
 I was plunged into darkness. My prayer was
 ended, but I cried to God in agony of soul to
 show me what I had done to grieve His Holy
 Spirit. I found no peace, so I returned to my
 Bible and opened to Matt. 8:22: “Jesus
 said unto him; follow me, and let the dead bury

 42 'BEULAH.
 their dead." I never could understand the
 meaning of that passage, and I turned the leaves
 to _ﬁnd something else, but they fell back to
 the same place, and as my eye rested on the
 same verse, it was like adding fuel to the ﬁre.
 Again I tried to turn the leaves; again my eyes
 rested upon the same passage. Like a ﬂash
 these thoughts were given me: Let the dead past
 be buried in the past. You have repented of
 all your sins and put them away, and the wit-
 ness *of your acceptance has been given you
 that your sins have been removed fromlyou, “as
 far as the east is from the west.” Now you
 have nothing more to do with them. They
 are “under the blood.” Follow me. I nid, I
 will, Lord Jesus. Happy consciousness; all the
 sins, mistakes and foolishness of my life are
 “under, the blood.”
 “I am out on the promises
 I’m under the blood.” _

 Bless the Lord! And if I have ever caused

 any to anger in qny way, I here ask their for-

  

 Lemmas on THE HOLY SPIRIT. 43

 giveness. I became very happy and praised
 God for the revelation, for through this trial I
 had learned the secret of hearing the sweet
 voice of my Lord speaking to me through His
 “Word.” And He says, Try me. And l ﬁnd
 it so comforting and assuring to my faith to bc
 directed by the “Sure Ward of God.” As som
 as I consecrated myself to Jesus, my lie-art
 went out to the suffering ones. I had not been
 able to ’go into a sick room for years without,
 in a measure, taking on the conditions of the
 sufferer. I had been such a great suﬁerer for
 years my whole being went out in sympathy.

 And now since I had found such a “balm in
 Gilead,” such a “Physician there," a. healer for
 both soul and body, 1 longed to tell the poor
 tempest-tbssed and suﬂering ones all about the
 power of the Great Physician. A lady who
 had been conﬁned to her bed mOst of the time for
 more than thirty years, often came to my mind. .
 Ἰ1 Wanted to go to her and tell the glad tidings
 of deliverance, but asked the Lord not tolet

 44 BEULAH.

 me go until He sent me. Several weeks after
 this I was led to visit her. While in prayer
 with her the assurance was given me she would
 walk. She had not stood nor walked for near-
 ly twenty years, and only a few steps in thirty
 years. She is now able to walk about some,
 sits up several hours a day, and rides out oo-
 casionally.

 I have had great boldness given me from the
 ﬁrst, to rest on “God’s Word.” I proclaimed
 at once, that she would walk. Soon after this
 a dear Christian friend said, “What if she
 .should not walk ?” I said, "The prayer of faith
 shall save the sick.” Again he said, “But what
 if she shouldn’t ?” I repeated James 5:15.
 Again he repeated his question, and I answer-
 ed the same. We honor the Lord by asking
 great things of Him, and believing He is able
 to perform them, for He says, “Come boldly to ·
 . a throne of grace, that ye may obtain mercy
 and ﬁnd grace to help in time of need.” When
 I felt my heart go out to the suﬁerihg ones, I

 LEADINGS or run HOLY smum. *45

 was led to ask for the gifts of faith, healing
 and miracles. At this time, however, I did
 not realize that the gifts of healing and mir-
 acles were two gifts. The Lord showed me
 immediately that He had granted my request
 and bestowed these gifts upon me by the in-
 stantaneous healing of a broken arm which
 had become a mass of corruption. The state-
 ment of which I will here give:

 About a month after my consecration I had
 repeated requests to visit an old lady who was
 suﬁering from the effects of a fall. I did not
 respond at once, as I feared, I hardly knew
 what. One Monday morning the Lord laid the
 burden upon my heart to go and see this lady.
 I prayed over the matter until near noon, when
 the Lord showed me clearly it was His will I
 should go. Although I had claimed the bless-
 ing of healing by faith, yet I was far from
 feeling this glorious manifestation. I was in
 great weakness and suffering at times; particu-
 larly this day my suﬁering was intense. It

 46 · BEULAH.

 seemed as though all my old diseases had re-
 turned with great ﬁerceness. Icould sit up
 only with the greatest" effort and constant
 prayer. At last, after getting myself ready, I
 was obliged to sit down for awhile before I
 could start. My Auntie was quite shocked,
 when she learned 1 w'us going out, and said
 thntl- looked as though I had better go· to bed.
 I started in the name of. Jesus. I had not ﬁve
 cents to pay my street car fare, audit was a
 longer walk than I had taken in a long time.
 My suﬁerings increased as I went und the pain
 I in my eyes was beyond description. I had
 laid inside my durk glasses, and could not be
 tempted uuder any circumstances to take them
 again. The rheumatism in my joints made it
 ulumst impossible for me to'move, and Satan
 was given power over me. Job 2:6. “And the

 Lord snid unto Satan, 'Behold, he is in thine Δ

 hand; but save his life," so that everything he-
 gun to turn durk before me. These were-some
 of the thoughts thntpassed tin-ought my mind:

 Lammes or ran now emur. 47

 You are a hypocrite; a. pretty subject to go and
 tell of Christ’s healing power. I cried might-
 ily unto the Lord to give me relief so I could
 go on; or if I was mistaken in the call, to in·
 crease the distress; only let me return home.
 As yet I was scarcely a block from home and
 there were ten blocks before me. I can never
 tell when relief came, but I was conscious as
 I went, every breath ‚was a. prayer; and oh, how
 I prayed that God would show His power if
 He really had heard my prayer in bestowing
 the gifts I had sought. The city missionary
 who had invited me to visit this lady and who
 lived in the lower part of the house, met me at
 the door with an exclamation of joy saying she
 had been praying for me to come all the
 morning. I will farther on insert her state-
 ment given in one of the city papers. We
 went, up stairs and found Mrs. Shepley sitting
 in a large chair with her arm m a sling and
 her hand badly swollen and inﬂamed. She
 was the picture of distress. and despair. She

 48 natum.

 said, “Mrs Griﬁin, my arm is bad, but my head
 is worse. If all the bones in my body were
 broken, the pain could not be asbad as it is in my
 head. I begged of my husband not to take me to
 the Asylum if my reason left me.” Mrs. Shepley
 had also suffered from catarrh for many years.

 I asked her if she believed God was able to .

 heal her. She replied, “I do.” I asked her if
 she believed He was willing to do it. Her re-
 ply was, “I do.” I then said to her, “Do you
 believe Jesus will heal you?" She said, “Yes,
 I do." I read to her the account of Miss
 J udd’s healing, in the “Prayer of Faith.” I
 then took the Bible, not knowing what Iwould
 read. The Lord gave me the 103rd Psalm. [
 danot know as I ever read it before; and I lit-
 tle thought what precious lessons on Divine
 Healing it contained. As I read, “Bless the
 Lord 0 my soul, and forget not all his beneﬁts:
 who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth
 all thy diseases; who'redeemeth thy life from
 destruction,” &c.‚ she took her arm out of the

  

 »numos or run noLY stI'r. 49
 sling and laid it upon her lap, saying, “I feel
 the healing power to the ends of my ﬁngers.”
 When she spoke of feeling the healing her
 hand and arm began to shake so violently that

 it shook her whole body. When I ﬁrst went
 in she tried to move that hand a very little
 with the other, and the suﬂering was depicted'
 on her face. We then knelt in prayer; when
 we arose from our knees she slipped the splints
 and bandage 0E over her hand, when 10! the
 swelling and inﬂammation were all gone; the
 ﬂesh and skin were perfectly restored, and
 nothing was left to mark the place of the
 loathesome sores but the appearance of a newly
 healed wound. Instantly she threw her arms
 above her head and ran toward me to embrace
 and thank me for healing her and taking away
 all the pain, saying, “I don’t feel any more
 pain in my head, arm or body than there is in
 that stove." Isaid, “Oh no, don’t give me'the
 praise. It was not me, Jesus healed you. Let
 us kneel and give Him the praise and thanks.”

 50 BEULAH.
 She said, “Call my husband ﬁrst.” When he
 came in, he sank into a chair and said. “What
 does this all mean?” She replied, “The Lord
 has healed me, and I am so happy." She pled
 with him to come to Jesus. He seemed to
 yield himself and there Was a great change in
 them. Several months afterward both united
 with the M. E. Church. A few moments after
 prayer: Mrs. Burton was called. She had
 dressed the arm in the forenoon when she saw
 it, a raw mass of corruption. But as shelooked
 and beheld the wonderful change* she nearly
 fainted, sinking pale and trembling into a
 chair. When she could speak she said, “Truly
 it is restored whole as the other." I left them
 praising God. After this, I heard Mr. Shepley
 testify in meeting that the Friday night before
 the healing, he ran for the neighbors and chil-
 dren to see his wife die.

 They lived in Grand Rapids more than a
 year after this. Mrs. Shepley was a regular
 attendant at the faith meeting, always testify-

 Lemmas 0F mn HOLY spmn‘. . 51

 ing to the love and power of Jesus, with a
 beaming face, praising God. After they
 moved to Chicago, I received letters from them,
 saying that they were well and happy an] had
 meetings at their house. Mrs. Burton, the
 City Missionary, states as follows:

 “Mrs. Shepley came back from Macatawa
 Park,Friday. July 17th, 1885. She was sick,
 and explained that on the preceding Monday
 morning she fell down a stairway, severely
 hurting her head and neck, and spraining her
 left wrist. One week after, Monday July 20th,
 she consulted a. physician, who pronounci d the
 wrist broken. He set and spintered it with a
 plaster pari» splint. During the three weeks
 that followed, her suﬁering from the pressure
 of the splint on the swollen and inﬂamed arm
 was distressing to see, and when removed by
 the/physician, Tuesday August 11th, quite a
 quantity of pus, ’blood and corrupted ﬂesh
 dropped into her lap. The doctor exclaimed,
 ‘Why did you net come to me before?’ Two

 52 BEULAH. -

 large cavities were left in her arm, one near
 her elbow and another near the wrist, besides
 several smaller ones in a condition nearly as
 bad. On Friday, August 14th, when the arm
 was ,bared for dressing, it looked, if possible,
 still worse, and she said it was even more pain-
 ful and sore. Monday, August 1’7, she was still
 carrying the arm in a sling, in this condition
 unable to ’ move it except with the other hand,
 and was groaning and crying with distress.
 It was so swollen, inﬂamed and spotted, that,
 fearing erysipelas, I urged her to see the doctor
 that day.

 “Once or twice during the preceding week, I
 had spoken to Mrs. Grifﬁn about visiting her,
 as I believed her cheerful, positive faith would
 do the suﬁering woman good, and perhaps pre-
 vent her from becoming frenzied. I remember
 saying to Mrs. Shepley, that morning, ‘I wish
 I had time to go and get Mrs. Griﬂin to come
 and see you to-day.‘ and about noon, Mrs. Grif-
 ﬁn came. It is but true to say I did pmy that

 I, if her coming would do good, she might be di-
 rected to come; still when she stood at my

 door, I was awed at the ‘immediateness of the
 “ answer. We went to Mrs. Shepley’s room, and

 I said to her-L'This friend will do you good,’ I

 and left them together. Not long after, I was
 called to ‘Come,’ and on entering the room saw
 a bright happy face in place of gloom and
 tears, and the diseased arm freed from splint
 and bandage and to all appearance well. No
 sign of swelling, inﬂammation or suppurating
 sores, but the arm looked like newly healed
 horns. She. moved the urm freely in every
 way, and the same afternoon washed a few piec-

 - es. The next day in the forenoon she did a

 large Washing. did her housework, and in the af-
 ternoon walked to and from a faith meeting at
 a place a mile or more distant.

 “The above statement in regard to my case
 is true. My aim and head are well, and I am
 happy in the Lord. Mas. J. A. SHEPLEY."

 ” 54 swam.

 ” When I returned home from this place,
 where God had so wonderfully showad His
 power, Iwas ﬁlled with a quiet, sweet peace,
 und these words kept singing to my soul, “Bless
 the Lord‘O my soul." I could not tell where I
 had seen them. For several days I searched to
 ﬁnd them, but-could not; when again I opened
 to the 103rd Psalm, [remembered where I had
 seen them. My soul has blessed the Lord ever
 since. I think I began to realize that the Lord
 had granted my request and bestowed these
 gifts upon me, and that if He did not see ﬁt to
 heal me instantly, He could heal others when
 He saw it was wisdom to do so.

 I have been wonderfully guided at times in ’.

 knowing the Lord's will by trying the spirits.
 1 John 4:1. "Beloved, believe not every spirit,
 but try the spirits whether they are of God.”
 I give this helpful experience because so many
 of God’s dear children really desire to do the
 will of God, but do* not know how to listen for
 the Shepherd's guiding voice. If a thought

  

 nummos 0F zum HOLY spun—r. 55

 comes frequently to my mind, l begin to in-
 quire if it is of the Lord. I am constantly ask-
 ing direction for each hour and moment of the
 day, that I may walk in my Heavenly
 Father’s way, and not in my own. I desire to
 be sure of His guidance; so I ask if the thought
 is of the Lord He will hold it upon my mind,
 and if it is not, He will remove. it. For we are
 to “bring into captivity every thought to the
 obedience of Christ.” 2 Cor. 10:5. Many
 times I am directed in this way when otherwise
 I would not know which way to turn. _

 When I ask for a token from the Lord l
 would not dare do otherwise than obey, leaving ~
 the result with Him; not mourning nor think-
 ing perhups, after all, I have made a mistake.
 n This the enemy tries to make me think some.
 times, but I refer it to Jesus, and it always comes
 out all right. If it is not just the way I
 would have desired it, it is the way Jesus di-
 rected.

 A CHAPTER IV.

 THE LEADINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
 (CONTINUED)

 A FEW months after my consecration,
 Conventions for “Divine Healing” were held
 in diﬁerent places. had a great desire to at-

 tend some of these; as Ifelt greatly in need ·

 of all the help and instruction I could receive
 oh this subject. _I asked the Lord to send me -
 the money with which to go, if it were His
 will. I made all preparations, so when the
 money came, I should be ready. The time
 came and passed, and no money; but I could
 say, “Thy will be done.” Another Convention,

 . LEADINGB or THE HOLY slum. 57

 I still nearer home. I asked again with the same
 results. Apother was held which seemed es-
 pecially desirable. This time I asked for a cer-
 tain test to know if it were the Lord’s will I
 had the money. The token was not given and
 I did not dare go. ’ Ι felt greatly disappointed

 ' but again could say, “Thy will be done.”

 Oh beloved, it is precious _to be in that state

 when we can say, “Thy will be done,” from the .

 depths of the soul; even when it is directly con-
 trary to our own earnest desires. We truly
 believe we are in the hands of a living God who
 knows all things, and what is for our best good
 and His glory. Circumstances proved to be
 such, that it might have been a great curse to
 my whole life, had I have had my own desires

 . granted. Every time I think of this, I praise

 God that I was willing to abide by His will.
 The Lord wonderfully opened up thetruths- J
 of His “Word” to my mind, until the Bible

 seemed full of this blessed Gospel of Divine _

 Healing and with it, a life “hid with Christ in

 58 BEULAH. =
 God." ’These grand truths seemed to stand.
 out boldly and clearly as though they were
 written in words of living ﬁre. Tbäse kindled
 a burning love in my soul which permeated my
 entire being and so ﬁlled me with His strength
 and glory that I felt if I held my peace, “the
 very stones would cry out." l told to every
 one the priceless privileges and blessings pur- .
 chased for us by the blood ovaesus.

 Some time after this, one eveningI heard
 that Mrs. M. Baxter of England was in Kala—
 mazoo. I instantly went to my room and knees
 to inquire of the Lord if it were His will for
 me to go and hear her. I almost beard Him
 say, G0. l arose, went to the ticket ofﬁce, pur-
 chased my ticket and left on the early train
 next day. I attended the afternoon and even-
 ing meetings, which were a “feast of fat things”
 to, my. hungry soul. I drank in every word
 and marked every passage and also had the
 privilege of cenversiug with her.

 u, Qu the cars as l returned, ΙΙ opened my Bible

 LEADINGS 0F Tun HOLY 3mm. BD

 and the Lord showed me why He had shut me
 up with Himself. Oh how Ifelt to praise Him
 Α that He had chosen to be my instructor. Psalms
 _ 32:8. “I will instruct thee in the way thou
 shalt go. I will guide me with mine eye."
 (Miss Carrie Judd came to Grand Rapids and
 q conducted the dedication of our“Beulah" Rest.
 As yet, these are the only two workers among
 the Faith people I have met. I was enabled to ’
 learn most precious lessons from each one of
 these trusting' ones.) i r
 I think this was really the time when I began
 to realize the healing was accomplished in in y
 body. I'knew the healing was going on all
 the lirne, and could claim the work done “by
 faith. Jesus said, “It is ﬁnished." This ﬁn-
 ished work of the cross was for me, and for my
 body as Well as my soul; If 1 took it. 1 could
 believe and now felt that He sent His Word
 and healed me. Psalm 107:20. Yes, even me.
 l learned more than this, that ,when J esus said,
 h in Matt. 11:28, "Come unto me all ye that _l'a- '

 60 mecum

 bor and are heavy laden and I will give'you
 rest," that I might go to Him for physical
 rest when I was weary, and He would give ’me

 ι this also. I am naturally of a Peter-like tem-

 perament, quick, impulsive and earnest; not
 much patience to wait for anything I desired.
 I was not fretful, but my long sickness had
 not had the eﬁect of making me more patient
 during delays. So I was obliged to learn these
 wonderful and blessed lessons during the wait-
 ing time, notwithstanding the many dark hours
 and severe tests I was obliged to pass through;
 most of the time my mind was staid on God,
 and a deep, sweet peace ﬁlled my soul. After
 the darkness had passed I was ﬁlled with the
 glory of God so that Icould always praise Him
 for the test and count it as one of the blessings
 of my life. It is not easy to endure trial, but ·
 when it is over and the joy of the Lord ﬁlls the
 whole being the trial is forgotten in the glory.
 The Lord never fails to send His angels to min-
 “ ister unto the tried ones as soon as they learn

  

 . LE‘ADINGB oF mn HOLY 39mm 61

 the lessons He would teach them, and the
 darkness is removed. By using me, God has
 showed me that He can use anyone who is
 really desirous of being used for His glory.
 For some years Ihad dreaded the snow in
 winter and desired never to see it again; felt ’
 disagreeable when it began to fall. I had a
 . great deal of fault to ﬁnd with the weather.
 Damp air caused rheumatic suﬁering; bright
 sunny days hurt my eyes; hot weather pros-
 trated me; and really there was very little '
 weather that pleased me. In regard to this the
 Lord spoke to ·me in a very sweet way, and I
 will give it as I noted it down at the time.
 While I was waiting on the Lord to be re-
 lieved of a physical burden that. was weighing
 me down, the snow fell through the window
 and rested on my dark shawl in delicate beauty.
 Isaw in each ﬂake a number of perfectly
 ’formed stars, varying inform and beauty, but
 each one reﬂecting light. I saw God’s hand in

 for no invention of man could produce any-
 thing like them. Then I thought, How many
 of God’s dear children think little trials, pains
 and diseases are not worthy His notice, and yet
 ’ He forms millions of these little ﬂakes of beau-
 ty, and frailty with such care; “0f how much
 more value are ye?” As I breathed upon them
 , they vanished; so it is with the child of God;
 when He breathes upon us, and we receive the
 Holy Ghost, we have no burdens, for we cast
 them upon Jesus and they disappear. Again,
 I saw how delicate is-that tender Spirit, and
 how easily grieved even by a breath of unbe-
 lief or doubtful thought, act or word. The re-
 - quest of my prayer was granted, and I praised
 the Lord for the few moments’ delay. The
 waiting time was not in vain, but was spent in
 . learning a swe t useful lesson. I have never
 found any fault with the weather since. I go
 out in sunshine or storm and the Lord keeps
 me. I feel that Christians commit great sin,
 in murmuring about the weather or anything

 else God is pleased to send us. _
 As soon as I had consecrated my all to Jesus
 I felt I must start a faith prayer meeting I
 only knew of one who would believe and join
 with me; this was my friend, Mrs. Winchester,
 from Buffalo. She came and helped me While
 she remained in the city. We were liable to
 interruptions, as my home and business were
 in the same house, so a friend living in the
 extreme south eastern part of the city invited
 us to her house for a time. Then the City
 Missionary. Mrs. Burton, invited us to meet
 with her. Quite frequently I Was the only one
 there. But Jesus always met with us, Matt.
 18:20, and we were blessed. Ἴ
 Satan often whispered. to me, This is ,no use;
 you had better give up. After a'time,1uore

 for. both ’soul and body. When Bible students
 came into the meetings, I was almost ready to
 give up and dared not take my eyes from my
 book.

 One morning about this time I opened to
 Jer. 1:6—9. I lost sight of Jeremiah, to-whom
 this was spoken, for it was now God’s own
 word to me. I have never been afraid of “their
 faces” since, for [know God is with me, and
 now.I am holding four full salvation cottage
 prayer meetings a week in the city. Souls and
 bodies are being brought to Jesus continually.
 Oh it is precious to know that Jesus never
 turned any away who truly came to Him; but
 He healed them, forgave their sins and blessed
 them. I cannot see how any can come to
 Jesus for the healing of their bodies without
 receiving a spiritual blessing, ii, they are Chris-
 tians; and if they are not, without giving their
 souls to Him, when they are healed. “Jesus
 Christ the same yesterday, to—day and forever."

 l was greatly exercised in regard to the com-

 nummos or THE n'omr sPIBI'r. 65
 mand in James 5:14, as I Was learning‘ that
 “obedience is better than sacriﬁce.” Accord-
 ingly I went to see two of the Deacons in my
 Church about this matter, and they said they

 - did not believe in this as the day of miracles

 was past. I "was now praying with several
 persons and wished to ﬁnd some one to anoint
 them, yet could ﬁnd no one who believed in this
 command. About this time I had some won-.
 derful lessons taught me. I had been greatly
 annoyed with agents; I had not always treated
 them as well as I ought.

 A lady came in one afternoon with a medi-
 * cal book to sell. Of course I did not wish it,
 but I treated her well, and listened to her story
 for “Jesus’. sake," for I was now beginning to

 see the seals of people for’whom Jesus had shed ‘ Q

 His precious blood, and realized that perhaps I
 , might-lead that one'to Jesus. I told her I had
 no use for anything of that kind, because I had
 taken Jesus as my Physician, medicine and
 health. She then told me of her daughter

 twenty-three years of age, who was a hopeless
 cripple. She had diphtheria when she was
 three years old, which settled in her spine and
 limbs; she had always been a great sufferer,
 and at this time was so great'that she could
 not go into her room without increasing her

 distress. I asked her if she would like to have

 us remember her in prayer.- She said she
 would. . Abon* two weeks after this I returned
 one day from making some calls, and found a
 young lady in the sitting room who proved to
 be the cripple for whom we had been praying.

 She was ’o much better that she was able with n

 assistance to swing- herself on her crutches to
 my house, a distance of ﬁve blocks. She said
 she did not know but she would stay a week.

 ’ This I did not, exactly, know how to take as she

 wasa perfect stranger. She staid with me the
 remainder of the day. and late in the evening.
 I asked her· if she would like me to pray with
 her before she Went back. I did so and after
 prayer she was able to arise in the name of Je-

 without her erut-chem, said she had never done'
 this before. l then saw th at the Lord had sent her

 thing to do for Him thus) day. As I was think-
 ing whether to say I would walk back with her
 or ask her to stay over night, (which was not
 very convenient) this came to me: “Inasmuch
 as ye have done it unto the least of these ye
 have done it unto me.” This settled it. i suid
 I would be pleased to have her stay, and I would
 take her to the meeting with me next day
 which Idid. It was with the- greatest eﬁvn
 that Mrs. Burton (City Missionary, at whose
 home we metthut day) and l could get her up
 three steps with the help of her‘crutehes. ¹ Her

 not put her hands to her head nor back of her.
 She was so distressed for breath that as she
 swung herself on her crutches her face grew
 purple. She also had a complication of diseases
 which were healed when we ﬁrst prayed for
 her at the faith meeting. I wanted some one
 to anoint her; could ﬁnd no one to do it. I
 prayed the Lord to open the way and help her
 to obey the “Word." I had ordered some
 books not knowing what they were, only from
 their titles. In the morning of the day l was
 to go to her, the little book entitled, "Healing _
 of sickness by Scriptural means” by Karl An-
 dreas, came to me. I had prayed much for
 light on this subject of anointing, and this lit-
 tle book gave a description of those who had
 the right on scriptural grounds to anoint.
 This showed it was those to whom God had
 given the gifts of Faith, Healing and Miracles.
 These would receive and experience the call to
 this work, the same as the minister would ex-
 perience the call to preach the Gospel, and if

 man-chosen elders of the church did not believe
 this part of the Gospel (as most of them do

 - .not) they surely could not use the oil. It came

 like a ﬂash that the Lord had bestowed these
 gifts upon me, and that I could use the oil in ⁷
 His name. I thought I could not; still the
 thought seemed pressed upon me that I was to
 do it.- _I prayed oyer it,.and asked theLord if

 it was His will that [should use the oil, to let '
 me remember to get it when I went up street;
 ifnot, to take it from my mind. When 1 went,
 Iiorgot everything but the oil. I returned and
 asked God’s blessing upon it, consecrating it to
 Him for this and no othe-k use. i then Went
 to Miss Abbott, telling her all about it. She
 replied, “I want you to use it'” Iasked the
 Lord to show His power, if it were pleasing to
 Him for me to anoint. I prayed with her and
 used the oil in His dear name. Immediately
 her joints began to snap and crack, so we could
 hear them all over the room, and the limbs be-
 gun to straighten, so that she placed one foot

 on'the stove hearth, and crossed the other over
 it, and said, “I never did that before." She

 also had the free use of her arms and could ·

 _ throw them behind her, and above her head.
 This showed me the Lord was pleased to have

 Some good Christian people objected tomy
 _ praying with the sick and anointing with oil.¹
 because I am a woman, forgetting that. Jesus
 received anointing for His burial from the
 hand of a. woman, and “that in Christ Jesus
 I there is neither male and female;" and He be·

 thut it was Jesus. not mun who chose and sent
 out the Disciples to “preach the Gospel and

 that He honors the labor of consecrated wo-
 men, as well as men; and He pours out His
 Spirit upon them and calls them the “daughters

 - ers with Jesus and the Apostles. I have learn-

 ed that the same word is employed in the Greek-
 language in speaking of the “elder women,” 1
 Tim. 1:5, that is employed in James 5:14. The
 Lord has honored my labors, obedience and
 faith in Him and His “Word” by the many
 wonderful signs which have followed; so that
 I could not doubt my calling and acceptance
 in this work, and the approval of my Lord,
 though the whole world and Church should
 combine against me. Matt. 18:6, 7: ‘fBut
 whoso shall oﬁenul one of these little ones which
 believe in me, it were better for him that a
 millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
 he were drowned in the depth of the, sea. Wo

 needs be that oﬁenees come; but wo to the man

 sire and prayer is that I may keep low at the
 feet of my coming King, and that I may be so
 “hid with Christ in God,” that self will be bur-
 ied out of sight. I realize very fully that “I

 am not my own." I have been bought with a
 price even the precious blood of the Son of God.
 My privilege and duty as a Christian are, to
 have so much of the resurrection life of Jesus’
 that it will strengthen my entire being, and
 so quicken my faculties that God can work
 through me mightily to will and to do His

 ' own good pleasure.

 CHAPTER v. o
 THE LEADINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
 (CONCLUDED.)

 ’ GOD had given me perseverance largely,
 and I entered with my whole being into any-
 thing that I was convinced was right and good.
 I am no less so in my Lord’s work, and engage
 iniit heartily and perseveringly. ’

 Α friend has said that the pocket-book was
 the last thing to be consecrated. (Too many
 forget that the Lord only lets us take His mon-
 ey to use for Him.) This was not the case

 with me. Ῐ immediately began to give my
 tenth, feeling that it was right for Christians

 74 BEULAH.

 thus to do. I was in debt and had hard work
 to meet my daily expenses. The question came,
 Oughtl to give a tenth? I asked the Lord
 about it, and laid awake the inost of one night
 with these words ringing in my ears: “She of
 her penury hath cast in all the living she
 had,” and our Lord commended her for it.
 .This seemed to satisfy me, but many times af-
 ter, when we had but little in the house to eat,
 l tried to excuse myself from giving but could
 not. Mal. 3:10: “Bring ye all the tithes into
 the store-house, that there be meat in mine
 house, and prove me now herewith, saith the
 Lord oi hosts, if I will not open you the win-
 dows ofheaven, and pour you out a blessing,
 that there shall not be room enough to receive
 it.” This is a free Gospel for soul and body,
 and no price is charged for anything. lam
 now living by the faith of the “Son of God,”
 as I believe God's W ord teaches all workers for
 Him should do. “Freely ye have received, free-
 ly give.” This does not exempt those who re-

 nummos or rm: Hon! em. 75

 ceive the free labors of God’s children from
 giving “free will oﬁerings" to them—as unto the
 Lord. We read: “The workman is ,worthy of
 his meat." Matt. 10:10. Paul often stirs up
 the Christians to be generous in gifts to those
 who labor for the Lord for their own beneﬁt.
 He says, “Not because I desire a gift; but I de-

 sire fruit that may abound to your account.” - ·

 Phil. 4:17. In verse 18 he speaks of their.gift3
 as “an odor of a sweet smell, a sacriﬁce well
 pleasing unto God.” I gave all my time and
 strength, but had almost nothing given me.
 Business was very low and things looked pretty
 dark; still I trusted ﬁrmly in Jesus who had
 hidden me “Go work in my vineyard.” Iknew
 if He saw ﬁt for me to suffer privation here,
 He would reward me by and by with incor-
 ruptible unfading treasures. My whole aim in
 life is to bring honor and glory to His dear
 name. My heart was ﬁlled with praise and
 gratitude, for now (several months after I
 claimed healing) I was quite strong and well

 76, BEULAH.

 ι and could labor with-comparative ease. I'had
 continued all along to claim healing, and had
 read more and more -,.eaeh day and evening in
 the name of Jesus, when it seemed that I could
 not endure the pain and distress caused from
 the light and eﬁortI made. This I told to no
 one but Jesus, and kept believing“God's Word”
 until I felt better. I learned many precious
 lessons of trust and patient waiting and faith-
 ful perseverance all the way throughout this
 trial of my faith.

 While engaged in my hair business I· had
 spent much time, thought and money in inven-
 tions of various kinds. I had many of these
 on hand. Among them, were preparations for
 the face, both pink and white. At a time when
 my need was very great, an order came for
 quite a quanity of the pink. I had just re-
 turned from the place of one who had given up
 her house of ill fame which she had kept for
 twenty years, who was trying to live a better
 life. I had said to her, “Wash that paint oﬂ

  

 mnnmss or rm; HOLY srmrr. , 7'7 ,

 your face, and dont use it again,” and here I
 was selling that which would produce the same
 effect. _ The thought came to me, How incon-
 · sistenti what if she should see my name upon
 this “Tint!” There are worldly men that I
 owe; and I needed the money in every. direct-
 ion. Here I could get some by ﬁlling this or-
 der, and perhaps close out the whole I had on
 hand. I earnestly cried unto the Lord to know
 what to do. I saw the whole thing to he so
 wrong; and I said, Lord if I starve, or am im-

 . prisoned for my debts, I will suﬁer it, rather

 _ than scatter seeds of sin any longer; I wrote
 · to the parties, telling them why Icould not ﬁll

 the order. In about an hour a dear friend .

 called and gave me $2.50 and later in the
 h day another gave $2.00 more. I felt happy be-
 cause I had done right, even if it did mean ’de-
 struction of some property. All was not yet
 settled; I had not“ disposed of the white paint.
 (I never called it paint, but I saw it now to be
 such.) Lused it myself, and had, ever since I

 was quite young; now came a hard struggle. I
 argued with the Spirit, I have always consid-
 ered it a part of my toilet; I cannot give it up.
 Still it was pressed upon .me that l* must give
 up its use and sale. I was enabled to say, Yes
 Lord, to this, and many other things I was call-

 * ed upon to lay aside. And I immediately

 washed my face, and carried out from my room
 and store for ever, those things which I now be-
 1ieve that no true child of God ought to use.

 I believe the Bible says something about q

 painted faces, Jer. 4:30, and is it not very im-
 portant that every true seeker of light and
 godliness should study God's “Word” more '
 about all the little things in our every-day life,
 which have such an effect on our lives and
 Christian inﬂuence, here and hereafter. I
 [had ‘another trial, so simple , that for a long
 time I did not mention it, yet it was more of a
 struggle for me to give it up than all my med-
 icines. I had used rosewater and glycerine,
 which would always keep my hands soft and

  

 LEADINGS or THE HOLY SPIRIT. '79

 white. When the Lord called for that, 1 nev-
 er dreamed what it would cost me to lay it
 aside. When I did so, my ‘hands chapped,
 cracked, smarted and distressed me so I cried.
 Satan whispered, It is not medicine, and surely
 you are not called to give'up everything. I say
 to my shame that I yielded to Satan and used
 itonce'or twice more. Then the Holy Spirit.
 showed me it was an unnecessary expense.
 Your consecrated hands are to be used »in the
 Lord’s service; can’t you trust Jesus to care for
 them? The money you pay for that will buy
 a few tracts that may save a. soul. Isa. 55:2;
 “Wherefore do ye spend money for that which
 is not bread? and your labor for that which
 satisﬁeth not?” Satan whispered, You have
 this, use it and you need not buy any more.
 Again I yielded, put on all I could and went to
 the stove to dry it in. I got my hand too
 near and burned it so it blistered. I now cried
 tears of penitence, and with great shamefaced-
 ness I went before my injured Lord for pardon,

 80 - · BEULAH.

 promising Him that if He would remove the
 pain, I would trust Him. The pain and blister
 was at once removed. My chapped hands still
 remained in a very sore and red condition. It
 .was then I learned that I had been proud of
 my white hands; this I never realized before

 When Satan would say, See how they look, I ’

 _ would say, No matter, they are the Lord’s

 hands,'and if He likes them well enough to use
 them. to His honor and glory, I am satisﬁed.
 After nearly a year, they became smooth again
 but never white.

 This is the only time I ever yielded to Satan
 in turning back to anything God called me to
 give up, except to put on. my glasses, as before
 mentioned. I had borrowed a little of the
 tenth set apart for the Lord, from time to time,
 to buy daily bread, but always paid it back the
 ﬁrst I had. One night it was told me that
 there was nothing in the house to eat but a lit-
 tle oat meal. I thought I would draw from
 the tenth again, but was led to pray earnestly,

 LEADINGS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. 81 4

 as to whether it was pleasing to ’the Lord for
 me to take this for our food. I was His child,
 giving my whole time going about doing good
 and teaching the “Word.” The tenth I had
 used mostly in tracts and reading matter that
 I was distributing freely in the name of Jesus
 and asking His blmsing upon each one. Many
 times I gave to people abundantly able to pay
 for them, who would not buy them but would
 read them if given them. I gave to all.

 I thought of one dear sister who lived in lux·
 ury and had not learned the lessons of self-de-
 nial which Christians may learn; when I had
 given her several, still she continued to ask for
 more to distribute, saying that she had once
 bought $5.00 worth of tracts and they were not
 returned and she could not buy any more.
 These things came before me this night, and I
 said, Lord, what shall I do? Again these words
 came to me; The poor widow’s two mites and
 our Lord‘s commendation of her, when He
 said: “All these have of their abundance cast

 82 . BEULAH.
 in with the offerings of God, but she of her
 penury hath cast in all the living that she had,”
 Luke 21:4, came before me again. I felt this
 was to show me that Iwas to trust Him for
 food, and said, I do trust Thee, and fell asleep.
 Before I was dressed the next morning a cus-
 tomer called and made a small purchase, giving ~
 me twenty-ﬁve cents which I used to buy food.
 My heart was ﬁlled with praises to God. ’
 The Lord often ﬁnds it necessary to trim us
 down a great deal, before He is pleased to be-
 stow, rich blessings upon us. Yes, He often p
 sees it is best to do this even before He can ’-
 give us the blessing of health. God always
 deals with us wisely. Often, “Ye ask and re-
 ceive not because ye ask amiss that ye may
 consume it upon your lusts.” .
 I have a natural love for the beautiful; and
 it has been hard all my life to be satisﬁed with
 common things. I still think good goods (not
 extravagant) are the best economy. I did
 not care for admiration; it was pleasing to me

 to satisfy my love and taste for pretty things.
 But 1 John 2:16, 17 says, "Love not the world;
 neither the things‘thnt are in the world. If
 any man love the world the love of the Father
 is not in him. For all that is in the world,

 adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, was
 more acceptable to God and the people and l
 gladly said, Yea, Lord.l to every call that would

 feel to cry to the Christian Church, How is this “

 state of things to be met at the Judgment bar
 of God?

 This was not so when Christ was upon earth.

 and “the common people heard Him gladly",

 CHAPTER VI.

 , SOME OF THE REASONS WHY ALL
 χ ΑΒΕ NOT HEALED.

 I THINK the principal reason is the lack ’
 of entire consecration, orliu other would, the
 failure on our part of making a full surrender
 of our will and self to the Lord. God does not
 invade the will Without our consent; and the
 ﬁrst thing to give up from our own free choice
 is oui· will; for it is always God's will to sanc-
 tify if we consecrate. In giving up the will, it
 · means more than to simply say, lam willing
 to give up anything, or be anything, or noth-
 ing, for Jesus” sake. This must be the senti-

 86 BEULAH.
 ment of our hearts and bebrought into prac-
 tical experience in our daily lives, in such a
 way that we will have the assurance in our own
 hearts, that God’s will concerning our life is
 being carried out in us. Thus He always re-
 quires us to say, “Thy will, not mine, be done,"
 und hold to it when the test comes. God often
 calls for the dearest idol of the heart, for He is
 a jealous G0d,7and will show us what these idols
 are, even though we may never have been con-
 scious of their presence. God's chosen and
 faithful ‘on'es, He calls to a. life cf separation
 from the world in all its rounds of giddy pleas-
 ure, fashion and carnal self-indulgence, and
 leads them to consecrate their time, talents
 means, home ahd all to His blessed service.
 The Lord hath need of thesis.

 Some say, ‚“If I am healed, I will give all to
 Jesus.” Beloved, He wants the consecration
 ﬁrst. It is not for us to say to God, If you
 will come to ’my terms,'1 will do for you thus
 and so, as a reward (for your faithfulness.

  

 musone WHY ALL ABE NOT HEALED. 87
 Some say, “I will try it.“ Think of trying
 God! It is for us to make a full surrender and
 walk as He, calls us to Walk from day to day,
 and’not fail or become discouraged it His Wis-
 dom Sees ﬁt to try and prove us, and prepare us
 to use the blessing when it is given for His
 glory. He sometimes keepsnus waiting on
 Him what seems to us a longtime before we
 receive the desire of mil-hearts in the-complete
 blessing. God is not in a hurty to- give. us
 blessings we are not prepared to receive. And
 His word says “He that believeth doth not
 make haste." Beloved, never did. I ﬁnd so
 much happiness as to sink into the will of the
 Lord, even when it is contrary to m‚y own will;
 a sweet peace ﬁllsmy entire being, and Hiswill
 becomes my w ll. .
 - Then again, self may be harder to yield than
 the will even. Self says, I cannot endure cer-
 tain things, it affects me so; such a person
 makes me nervous; I can’t see them. Forget-
 ting that that soul is one for _whom Jesus died,

 88 natum.

 and perhaps He has something for us to do to
 help just that one. Again, self says, I cannot
 eat any thing if I cannot have just whatI want;
 and so keep some one cooking and worrying to
 tempt the appetite, when perhaps, that person
 is little better able to do this work than the
 sick one. Dear friend, if you really believe
 that Jesus blesses your food when you ask Him
 you would have no need of so much precious
 time, strength, labor and money spent for
 naught. If you believe, Jesus will always bless
 that which is good, strengthening and nour-
 ishing and He will cause your soul to delight
 itself in fatness if you partake with singleness
 of heart. ' For many years I had a distressing
 stomach trouble. This continued in much of
 its fury for a year or so after I claimed heal-
 ing, but when I was willing to deny myself
 expensive luxuries and really believed that Je-
 sus did bless my food, and would “ext what was
 set before" me with a truly thankful heart,
 knoviing that God‘s blessing was upon it,

 friends may pity, after a time they become dis-

 learned that self must be put out of sight,
 nothing but Jesus must be seen. I then learn-
 ed to my shame that much of our sensitive-

 occupied, there is ’little or no room for Jesus.
 We should be so ﬁlled with Jesus and the Word

 Again many weary sufferers doctor year af,-

 Again. many peopledo not seek the glory of
 God alone. This should be the central idea in
 every Christian heart. And one way to glorify
 God is to present our bodies a living sacriﬁce
 untoHim in sickness:for healing. This is well-
 pleasiug to Him, according to James 5:14, 15.-

 ner. » We are not made just alike, are not con-

 have received it. We are to lose sight of con-

 CHAPTER VII.
 SOME 0F 'I‘HE REASONS WHY ALL

 ABE NOT HEALED.
 (CONCLUDED.)

 THERE are trusting, waiting ones who
 seem to be doing ⁴all the Lord requires. Walk-
 ’ing in faith, and yet they wait and suffer for u.
 long time. To these I would say that the
 a Lord’s time is not our time, and in your sweet
 patient‘trust you are glorifying God and being
 made partakers of Christ's sufferings. Do not
 be discouraged and give up your, conﬁdence.
 “For ye have need of patience that a'fter'ye

 ” h have done the will of God ye might receive the

 98 BEULAH.

 promise." Jesus prayed for Peter that his
 “faith fail not.” Oh, take that prayer for your-
 self, and consider that He can show through .
 you His keeping power. Even though you
 seem to grow worse, “fear not, only believe."
 You know not what glory may come to the
 Son of God through your patient faith.
 Through these delays more may hear of your
 disease, conditions and faith, and will learn of
 the power of God. Though one disease, after
 another, relapse after relapse and test after
 test come upon you, trust on, stand ﬁrm, “be
 strong.” The Lord teaches such ones wonder-
 ful lessons if they will but listen to His gentle
 voice. Oh beloved, the waiting time though
 long and weary is not lost time.

 Again, some cling to little remedies; this
 shows that they have a divided faith. The re-
 mark is often made, “I baveno faith in med-
 icine," yet they cling to it with a slight hope
 of relij. and thus their faith is not perfect in
 the power of Jesus. Prayer, according to James

 REASONS wHY ALL ARE NOT mum 99

 5;14, 15 and the laying, on of hands in the
 name of the Lord, Mark 16:17, 18, is the means

 that the Lord directs His people to use. We '

 bring dishonor upon our Lord and His cause
 and lose a rich spiritual blessing if we do oth-
 erwise. When Jesus calls I want be found
 in faithful service and perfect trust.
 Many lose the blessing because they do not
 go to Jesus with the first symptoms; then if
 the blessing is withheld, call for the praying I
 ones as they would for a physician. Oh, how
 . my heart aches for these dear, discouraged ones.
 I can only say to you in the name of Jesus, Do
 not fer;a only trust Him. “He knoweth (our
 i frame, He remembereth that we are dust," and
 will not suﬁer us to be tempted above that we
 are able to bear.

 Perhaps most of those who seek Divine Heal-
 ing are those who are past all human help, and
 come with little or no expectation of health
 from the hand of the Divine Healer.

 Fear is one of the strongestihdidgthat the

 10044.. , mum.

 enemy can get upon the soul. Many fear to
 tell what the Lord has done for them and thus
 ‹ delay or lose the blessing. Jesus says, “yeare
 my witnesses.” And if we neglect to give God
 · the gloryfor the blessings we have already re-
 ceived, greater ones may be withheld.

 Another reason may be, because we do not
 take a stand with God against sin. God says,
 “Curse ye 'Meroz because they came not up to
 the help of the Lord against the Mighty." Read
 Deut. 28:16-68. The diseases there named are
 common to-day.

 ⁷ We are told of a cause of sickness and death
 . in 1 Cor. 11:27-31. “Because ye eat and drink
 unvorthily, not discerning the Lord’s body.
 For this cause many are weak and sickly among
 you, and many sleep." May not this apply to
 deacons who rent buildings for saloons -and
 lewd purposes and to those who ‘ go from the
 theater, opera, dance, club-house and card-table
 to the {lord's Supper?
 Again'ﬁ'e ask and receive not because ye ask

 amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts."
 Some seem to have no desire for the glory of
 God. They wish health that they may enjoy
 themselves better. Dear friends, should we
 not all more fully realize that health is a rich
 gift from God and should be used for His glory. .
 and not to carry out our plans of pride, pleas.
 ure and worldly living?

 Perhaps there is no greater reason why'the
 ⁴ blessing is delayed than anxiety. The Word
 says, “.Be anxious (R. V.) for nothing, but in.
 everything by prayer and supplication with
 thanksgiving make your requests known unto ’
 God.” Rest in the promises of God. If these
 only were given it should beenough. “The

 · prayer of faith shall. save the sick” διε. The

 Bible has nearly as many promises for the
 health of the body as for the salvation of the
 soul.

 Some are mourning over lost blessings. We
 are commanded to “forget the things that are.
 behind andpress forward to the things that are

 102 BEULAH.

 before." If the past is repented of and sins
 forsaken, it is under the blood and we have
 nothing to do with it. We live moment. by
 moment by the faith of the Son of God, end
 we must act in the living present, “Christ
 within -us the hope of glory.”

 Again the seeking ones fail to reach out and
 take the blessing that their loving Savior holds
 out to them simply because they cannot see or
 feel it. Let go of everything and drop into the

 ‚ everlasting armsland the blessing. is yours.

 Again God sees the* abusive use that some
 may make of health eve-n to the loss of the
 soul, and He does not dare to trust the blessing
 of health with such, for they would take it
 und return not to give God the glory. The
 Word says, “What shall a man give in ex-
 change for his soul;" thus we see that God es·

 . timates the value of the soul more highly than

 anything else and wisely withholds for greater
 honor to His own name. Beloved, be patient
 in llis dear hand and learn of Him.

  

 REASONS war ALL nan NOT HEALED.’ 103

 Again God has often shown me the blessing
 so near that it seemed to me that I could and
 f did grasp it for the sufferer; yet alack some
 way hindered the blessing, and God was blamed.
 Oh think of this, Jesus has purchased eternal
 life and health for you and offers it to you with
 blood-stained hands. Come, consecrabo youré
 selfto His service and enter upon His Work,
 and your reward will be great both here and
 hereafter. The ﬁelds are white all ready to
 harvest but the laborers are few. Jesus needs
 you and all He has lent to you. No health is
 so precious as the health you take from his
 hands, and use for His glory. ’
 . Some say, “How do 1 know that it is God’s

 will to heal me?" Did you ever stoptocon- '

 sider whether it were God’s will for you to re-
 cover when you were doing all you could to get
 Well by earthly means? Think, "Himself took
 our inﬁrmities and bare our sicknesses." Matt.
 8:17. How can you doubt His willingness to
 heal you, when He has already provided heal-

 ing ‘for your body by His death on the cross,
 and borne your sicknesses. Only come into
 His conditions and the'blessing may be yours.

 If you are appointed to die before you have
 t lived out your allotted time (“three scere years
 and ten”) years may be added to your life, even
 as they were to Hezekiah's in answer to prayer.‘

 The faith to be healed is a sweet, simple.
 trust; so simple, that perhaps you do not see or
 comprehend it. Just believe the promise be·
 cause Jesus says so. With the health that we
 receive direct from Jesus‘ hands, comes a spir-
 itual blessing that we can never receive in any
 other way. ’

 Many are kept from stepping out on the .
 promises because of the opinions of others. ’
 Sometimes a Christian, or even a minister of
 the Gospel of Jesus, tells them, “The day of
 miracles is past." This is a favorite expression
 of those who do not understand the Gospel of
 Healing. If One is not instantly healed, they
 tell him he had “Better use common sense.

 REASONS WHY ALL ARE NOT HEALED. 105

 God made herbs for medicine." 8m. God’s
 - Word says, “I have given every green herb fur
 meat." Gen. 1:30. Again they may fear rid-
 icule, or some kind friend may tell them of
 some remedy or physician who Will surely help
 them, and the suﬁemr reaches out to the “arm
 of ﬂesh." God really and truly undertakes for
 ever; one who puts his care into His hand,
 and He bestows the blessing just as soon as the
 soul is prepared to receive and make good use
 of it, _

 One may dishonor God as much in becoming
 discouraged and withdrawing his case from
 His hands when he does not receive the bless-
 ing in just the time and way that he would ·
 like as when he gives his soul to Him for
 healing and does not realize the change he
 expects and turns back to the World.

 Many cannot get beyond feeling. If the bud
 feelings and symptoms are not removed, they
 watch them instead of the promises God: We
 need to take the same place of faith ἷὶῐιρῒὲᾉὺῐυ-

 ham took. “Calling those things which were, ä
 as though they were not.” This implies not
 considering the disease of our body. “Stagger- ν-
 ing not at the promise through unbelief; but

 before the blessing comes. Do not wait a short J
 time only but continue waiting until the bless- Δ
 ing is realized. We have no promise of reward ‹
 and eternal life only as we prove steadfast and
 immovable unto the end, in the “full assurance ~
 of faith.” ‘
 Some think one who has been healed of the
 Lord will never be sick again. Now we have
 no promise that we never will be sick after
 once healed, any more than that we cannot sin
 after we are once converted. God says, “If
 any man sin, we have an advocate with the
 the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.” This
 rule is just as applicable to sickness. When
 the ﬁrst symptoms appear, instead of drawing
 on gleans for -'re1ief we should go to
 Jesus borne our sickness, and give it

 · all to Him; then it becomes His not ours,.and
 when the trial of our faith is perfect,.He
 will send relief. The child of God will 'never
 be beyond Satan‘s touch in this life, but Jesus
 is ever near and “He is faithful who .has prom-
 ised who also will do it.” Praise the Lord.
 Some dear ones who question God’sswill to
 . heal them are spending hundreds and pexhaps

 · thousands oi. the Lord’s dollars (which. He

 needs in His work) trying change of. climate

 otherwise go to some faith rest and give much
 less than they would pay at other places for
 board. They then wonder why a. rich blessing
 is not pouredzout on them. ,May the Holy
 Spirit bring these truths home to everyone who
 is dealing thus with the “living God.” He also
 says, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto. the

 least of these, my little ones ye have done it
 unto me.”

 Again I hear it said, “I may not recover if I
 give up my doctor and medicines.” Dear reader
 are you sure that these will cure you? And
 should you thus recover, could you feel that
 honor would be brought to the name of Jesus
 alone, and your soul ﬁlled with the joy that can
 only come through obedience and love to God
 and His word?

 The Lord sometimes withholds the blessing
 that He may ﬁt us for His work, or lead us to
 give up something that is displeasing to Him.
 1 John 3:22: “And whatsoever we ask, we re-
 ceive of Him, because we keep his command-
 ments, and do those things that are pleasing in
 His sight."

 Our precious Jesus, who has paid the price
 of His own blood to save and heal us, is pleased
 to have us come often and learn of Him, and
 thus teach us new lessons of trust and obedi-
 once.

 Many dear tried ones do not understand the
 wiles of the enemy. They do not realise that
 if they will keep close to Jesus, "He will bruise
 Satan under their feet shortly."

 I believe that we should “confess our faults °
 one to another,” as we are bid do in James 5:16
 and “pray one for another that we may be
 healed.” If the churches were open to let the
 “blind and lame” in for prayer and healing,
 Matt. 21:14, “And the blind and lame came to
 Him in the temple and He healed the1u,"in-
 stead of for concerts, fairs. suppers, operas, and
 theatricals and buying and selling in the tem-
 ple of God, Matt. 21:12-14, and if special meet-
 ings were called for prayer for the sick of the '
 Church, as they “were gathered together pray-
 ing" for Peter's deliverance when he was in
 prison, and the ministers would thus act when
 ill, instead of doctoring a long time, and then
 going to Europe or California for their health.

 to be directed of the Holy Spirit, I opened the
 Bible and Was showed these words: “The silver

 greater than of the former, saith the Lord of

 last clause ofthird und fourth verses of Hub. 2:
 “Though it tarry wait for it, because it will
 surely come, it will not tarry. But the just
 shall live by faith.”

 Soon after this I had an opportunity of talk-

 ing with a gentleman acquaintance about buy· A

 inquiring if he had u place suitable for my use.

 A few days later he called to say that he had a ’

 house that I might go and see. I went and
 found it in un unﬁnished state, and so many nec-

 stration of God’s power. The oil was out, and
 there was but little in the lamps. We wege

 ‘ Evening came, the lamps were lighted as us-
 ual, and burned quite late. Next morning the
 girl said, “There is as much oil as there was
 yesterday." I looked, and there surely was.

 next day being dedication, again the question
 was asked, “What shall we do for oil for the
 lamps?" I I said, “The Lord will provide."

 thought came, That is money for oil.

 The next morning we had a yery sweet sea-
 son of prayer and anointing. Among the _
 number who received the anointing, were two

 M. E. Ministers. .
 There have been many genuine converts

 to the Work, who are now good working Christ· μ

 ians; rejoicing in the Lord, and working for the
 salvation. of others. This is a marked feature
 of this work, that those who give soul and body.
 to Jesus, are so blessed that they seek to bring
 others to Him; and all Christians who conse-
 crate their bodies to be healed, cleansed and ﬁt.~
 ted for the indwelling of the'Holy Spirit, re-
 ceive such a spiritual quickening that they go
 and do likewise. I am often asked how I pay
 for the place. Fifteen dollars was given me by
 one of the converts, and by great self-denial I
 was enabled to lay aside ten dollars more, so I

 secretion I sent them to be set. I had a fond-

 ﬁnger rings. I had the ring made ﬁrst and
 wore it a few times. The pin and earrings
 came, just after my consecration. I gave them
 all to the Lord and placed them in the Bank
 for safe keeping, until my Lord called for them
 hoping that they might go into a home for
 Him, and they did.

 was' more than a principle, as they teach. A
 Methodist minister directed her to come and

 that this was the true Bible way. She accepted ‘

 “so-called” Christian Science. 1 Tim. 6:20, 21.
 The contract is drawn up, and I am to pay
 $2,750 for the property. Taking out the
 amount paid, $2,510 is left to be paid as the
 Lord may send me the means. I have been en-
 abled thus fur to make the small payment of
 ﬁfteen dollars each month. This is less than
 ﬁfty cents each month on the principal over the
 seven per cent. interest. The contractor has '
 kindly oﬁertd to credit me with one hundred
 dollars for every ninety dollar payment I can
 make at one time. I trust and pray the dear
 Lord may soon undertake for this branch of ,
 His work and that we may be able to give Him
 a clear deed of His own property.

 I have no collections, no price for guests, or
 my services. I believe that all should be “free
 will oﬁerings” as unto the Lord. Ican trust
 Him to move the hearts of the people, inan-
 swer to prayer, to make “freeiwill oﬁerings" to
 carry ,on this, His own work. Ialways feel

  

 _ BEULAH. 129
 great gratitude to Him and every instrument
 He uses in helping us, and praise Him for much
 or little. I try not to speak of my needs only
 to Jesus, and He answers in wonderful and
 most unexPected ways. My earnest prayer is
 that Heaven's richest blessing may rest upon
 every contributor. .

 CHAPTER IX.

 “BEULAH.” -
 (CONCLUDED. )

 THIS month He saw ﬁt to test my faith
 in regard to the payment, by letting it run two
 weeks past due. I was daily asking for the
 money and expecting it. One who had been
 greatly blessed in coming to “Beulah,” and had
 been led of the Lord to do much for the work
 here, wrote me, asking how the ﬁnances
 were. She thought that she had a right to
 know, as she felt that she was a part of “Beu-
 lah.” I replied that the Lord had met all our
 daily needs, and monthly payments until the
 present month, and that I was looking daily to

 anunm. 131

 Him for this.

 To this, the following immediate answer
 came back to me: ’

 “About ﬁve weeks ago, an insurance policy
 that I had,- expired, which I thought to renew,
 at a cost of $37.50. ι The Holy Spirit whispered
 this question to me: How would you like to in-
 sure with the Co. of Heaven? Now there is my
 servant Dora at ‘Beulah;’ you know she is all
 the time looking to me to supply her needs, and
 I am using her time and work in my vineyard.
 I have got to provide her monthly payment
 now, and if you will insure with me, and trust
 in me with the same feeling of safety that you
 have in the Phoenix 00., here is a chance,
 and you may use that $37.50 as I may direct.
 First you may send $15.00 to ‘Beulah,’ to
 make the payment for this month. I said, I
 believe I can do that and trust Thee to make the
 insu rauce safe, and the investment good. But
 I am ashamed to say‘ that I asked the Lord if
 He would not allow me to use the. money until

 1325 · mecum

 after the ﬁrst of the next month, as I had a"
 large payment to meet at that time, and then l
 would do as He signiﬁed. But if He really did
 want me to send it now, to make it very plain.
 Then your letter came, saying that you were
 expecting the dear Lord to sent you themoney
 every day. This was about as plain as I needed n
 as you never answered me this question before.
 Now here I have been holding the Lord’s money
 so you see that He had planned all this for you
 in the proper time for it to be paid.

 Again I said, How can I send it just now
 when I have all this money to raise so soon?,
 The answer came, Can’t you trust me. to give
 you enough to make it up? Have you not said:
 that your money, time, strength and all were.
 consecrated to me? Yes Lord, I have said it.
 Have I not always cared for you, paid your
 bills when they were due, and opened the way
 so many times when it looked so dark? Yes
 Lord, and I will send it right off, this morning
 to your servant Dora, and to the other place,

  

 immam. ~ 133
 where they are praying and waiting for it, and-
 trust Thee to open the windows of heaven and
 pour me out a blessing. As I took up my Bi-
 ble I said; Lord, I do believe that this is what
 you would have me do. Now give me some
 word from Thee, on-which my eyes shall first
 rest guided by thy Holy Spirit, that shall assure
 my heart that this is Thy will, and Oh, 3va

 from Heaven said to me: ‘And go Quickly; lo,
 I have told you before.” One mightJook all
 day in the Bible for a more direct answer,
 without ﬁnding it plainer.

 Now I have written you'all this to encourage
 your heart to trust in the ‘Living God.‘ So
 you can see as well as I, just how the Lord does I
 operate to answer prayer for His faithful
 people, and how He was all the time getting
 the money ready ,for you. It is just as good
 for me as for you, to see all this, and I just burst

 out in praises to our God while rivers of water Δ

 ran down my eyes to think that the Lord does

 make the way so plain for His people because

 . they trust in Him. So here is the Draft and

 here is the story, and I tell it to you because
 He says, ‘Wherefore comfort one another with
 these words;‘ and I know this will."

 I will never be able to express the unspeak-
 able joy I feel in living a life of trust. My
 faith is never tried, without having a wonder-
 ful revelation of the glory and peace of Jesus,
 after the severity of the testis passed. In each
 trial I am shown my own nothingness and ma-
 ny faults, and also get a view of the great and
 Holy One who enables me to overcome. In
 James 1:2, 3, we are told to “count it all joy
 when ye fall into divers temptations, knowing
 this that the trying of your faith worketh pa-
 tience." It is a great comfort to me to know
 that nothing can come to me, unless permitted
 by my Heavenly Father; so it must be for my
 good.

 , For several weeks after coming to “Beulah,”
 everything ran low; at times we hardly had

  

 _-,_‘

 sauna. 135

 enough from meal to meal, but never suﬁered.
 It kept me coming to my Lord continually for
 the supply of our daily necessities. I was so
 short of help, that I had to spend more time at
 work about the place than I ought, and I was
 led to cry mightily unto God for help. I arose
 from my knees and opened the Bible and this
 was given me: Eze. 36:11, 29, 37: “I will mul-
 tiply upon you man and beast, and I will do
 better unto you than at the beginnings, and ye
 shall know that [ am the Lord.” “I will also
 save you from all your unoleanness, and I will
 call for the corn and will increase it, and lay no
 famine upon you.” “I will yet for this be in-
 quired of."

 I took my Lord’s “Word” for myself, and
 have been greatly delivered in every time of
 need. Sometimes when the house is full of
 guests we get almost out of daily food but be-
 fore the real need comes, we are provided for.

 After we had been in “Beulah” but a short

 . time, a gentleman came who had cancer of the

 136 mmm.

 stomach. He was able to sit up part of the
 time, but continued to fail rapidly, and was
 soon taken with black vomit; he lived about
 ﬁve weeks. From the ﬁrst, he had no real de·
 sire to live; he was prepared to die, yet said he
 was willing to live if it was God’s will, but he
 never reached out after life. He was wonder-
 fully kept from the distress, which usually at-
 tends that disease, in answer to prayer; we had
 many and remarkable answers to pr yer for his
 relief, so that very often before the prayer was
 ended, he would fall into a sweet restful sleep,
 and at the end of ﬁve weeks he fell asleep in
 Jesus.

 From a human standpoint, this was a great
 mystery and very discouraging. Why God
 permitted this to occur at the opening of the
 home, and almost the ﬁrst one who came, we
 could not understand. The many assurances
 given me'all through his sickness, I took as to-
 kens for his restoration. This for a time

 ’ greatly perplexed me. When I came quietly

  

 nnuma. 137

 before the Lord, to inquire of His dealings with.
 me, I was shown many lessons; He had given
 me these assurances to enable me to hold on to
 the promises in faith for the blessing of relief, ·
 which was not a small blessing. He was un-
 doubtedly appointed to die, and the Lord had
 sent him here for many reasons. One was to
 test me. I was not discouraged, for I knew
 that if our Lord did not see ﬁt to raise him to
 health in answer to such prayers as were offered
 for him, nothing would save him. The post
 mortem showed that no human skill could have
 reached his case. His friends were all satisﬁed.
 Even in this trial, I could pr⁶aise the Lord. I
 felt that the constant prayer had brought me
 into a secret place with the Lord which I had
 not known before.

 I The work is‘ constantly going on for both
 soul and body. I am able to reach many souls -
 that I could not approach were it not for the
 Gospel of Healing. Faith prayer meetings are
 held at Beulah, every Wednesday at 2:30 P. M.

 “Beulah” is not a home for persons to come
 and remain any length of time as ome have
 supposed. It is not a hotel, hospital or alms-
 house. It is a quiet home, with .“J esus in the
 midst," where the weary, sick, tried, unsaved
 ones may come for a week, or at most, for a
 few days-and learn more of this way of faith
 for all things. No price is charged. Those
 coming, do what they can as the Lord leads,

  

 mmmm i 139

 4 and they give entirely as “free will oﬁerings,"
 for .which I am very thankful. I wish none to
 remain away, (who really desire to learn the
 blessed way of faith,) for lack of means; for I
 can trust the Lord to provide necessary food.
 Guests will please communicate with me be-

 fore coming and state whether they are able to ( v

 wait upon themselves. If they‘ are not, it will
 be necessary for them to bring an attendant.
 Also if they are able to take a room upstairs, as
 lonly‘have two sleeping rooms on the ﬁrst

 ThOse who may desire me to go out of town
 to hold meetings or visit the sick will please
 send me the money for expenses.

 n “Beulah” is situated one-half block from

 East Street on which the Wealthy Avenue ‚
 Street Car runs. It is the fourth house on the
 left-hand side of Baxter Street, east of East
 Street. I

 It "contains two lots. The house is two sto-
 ries; bay-windows below and above in front.

 The large front room is used as a chapel; fold-
 ing doors between the chapel, hall and sitting
 room; these rooms when thrown together, make
 a large seating capacity. There is not an un-
 pleasant room in the house. “Beulah” stands
 on a nice elevation of ground where the air‘is
 pure and clear. My room joins my dear aged
 Auntie’s, who is my adopted mother, and all I
 am I owe to her, under God. As I look out of
 my window upon the eastern sky, I feel to
 praise God that my lines have fallen in such
 pleasant places, and often wonder if from this
 beautiful retired elevation I may be permitted
 to behold Jesus, coming in the clouds of heaven.
 I am looking for Him, and my constant prayer
 is that my lamp may be trimmed and burning,
 with oil in my vessel when He comes.

 “Watch therefore, for ye know not what
 hour your Lord doth come." Matt. 24:42.

 When the men were about to dig the well, I
 asked the Lord not to let them strike water un-

  

 til they had reached gravel so it would be pure A

 and good; also that it might be soft. When I

 inquired about it, they said that they struck a ”

 gravel vein at the depth of thirty feet. “ The
 ,water was clear, sweet, and so soft that it would
 make suds as easily as rain-water.

 The reason why Christians do not receive
 blessings in temporal matters is because they
 do not ask for them; “Ye have not because ye
 ask not,” ~James 4:2, and thus they deprive
 themselves. a great many spiritual encourage-
 meats and blessings which would accompany
 them. , I never drink water without thanking
 God for this rich gift, and asking His blessing
 to rest upon it.

 Nothing in our lives is smaller than the
 hairs of our heads, yet Jesus says that they
 “are all numbered.” I

 C CHAPTER X. l
 SPIRITUAL GIFTS. _

 HOW often I hear it said, “The day of
 miracles is past.” Now who said this? Cer-
 tainly not Jesus, nor His believing disciples;
 nor His Word. Jesus knew when He gave
 His last commission that nothing would con-
 vince an hnbelieving world so thoroughly as
 the pOWer He gave to His people to do signs
 and Wonders in His name. Then again He de-
 signed that His redeemed sons and daughters
 should be delivered from the bondage of Satan
 through faith in His name. Mark 16:15—18.

 Our Lord's last words to His diseiples were:
 "G0 ye iutn all the world and preach the Gus— '

  

 SPIRITUAL sins. 143

 pel to every creature," διο.

 We know the Christian Church accepts this
 gospel of salvetion,but rejects what follows, i. e.
 the Gospel of Healing and gifts of the spirit.
 Jesus says in verse seventeen; “These signs
 shall follow them that believe.” This does not
 look asthough these signs were only to follow
 the Apostles, for Jesus says, “them that believe." ι
 If you believe that, the signs will follow you,
 if you use your privilege. Ah, dearly beloved,
 "We are not debtors to the ﬂesh to live after
 the ﬂesh," the unbelieving maxims of this world
 or the traditions of men. We are not govern-
 ed and controlled by natural laws, entirely. It
 is necessary for us to rise superior to
 _our surroundings, ourselves and all nat‘
 ural law, to assert our liberty in Christ Jesus.
 Jesus makes this remarkable statement in verse
 eighteen: “in my name shall they cast out dev-_
 ils;” This is not only our privilege but our
 duty, and God gives this power when the con—
 ditions are met and we accept His powor and

 144 nnuma.

 use it for His glory. “They shall speak with
 new tongues.” This was one of the most no-
 ticeable gifts given at Pentecost. I remember
 hearing Mrs. M. Baxter, of England, relate an
 incident of he; Christian labor bearing on this
 point. She had a pressing invitation to speak
 to a German audience on Divine Healing. She

 ι did not know the German language, but felt « h

 that she could claim this promise. She went
 trusting the Lord to give her the power to
 make them understand. When she arose to
 speak, she uttered the sounds that came into
 her mind. One person was converted from the
 evening's talk .and the people were very sur-
 prised to learn that she knew nothing of their
 language, yet had spoken to them. Other in- '
 stances are on record similar to this. “They
 ’ shall take up serpents, and if they drink any
 deadly thing it shall not hurt them." We be-
 lieve that God will show His. power in protect-
 ing His believing children. “They shall lay
 hands on the sick and they shall recover."

  

 SPIRITUAL GIFTS. 145

 This is the foundation text for God’s faithful
 ones to base their faith upon in being used as
 God’s ministers in the healing of the body.
 What an exalted privilege God’s children have

 - of using the power of Jesus’ name above and
 against all human means for the relief of the
 suffering ones. Had Vanderbilt, Gould or As-
 tor given you the privilege to use their names
 to draw on the Bank for all the money you
 wished, how quickly you would avail yourself
 of this opportunity in every time of need. Now
 here is one who holdeth the wealth of the world
 in His hands; and He will not only give us
 spiritual but temporal and physical blessings;
 for all power is given into His hands, not only
 in heaven but in earth. Now He Ofen you
 freely the use of His all-powerful name. In
 Jesus’ name we can cast the devils out of our
 own souls and bodies, and we can also lay the
 name of Jesus upon others with a similar
 eﬁect.

 I often wonder how far God will hold us

 146 noun.

 guiltless for not using these blood-bought priv-
 ileges; for this was the last commission and
 promise that Jesus gave before His ascension
 to His Church and Bride. those to whom He
 expected to show forth His power on earth.
 “And they went forth and preached everywhere,
 the Lord working with them and conﬁrming
 the Word with signs." He works to—day with

 His believing ones the same. Oh my fellow ~

 laborers in the Lord, our duty is to live where
 we can have liberty in declaring the whole
 Gospel in power and demonstration of the
 spirit. v

 In 2 Cor. 12, Paul reminds the Church of
 its incompleten without these various spir-
 itual gifts, even as the human body is incom-
 plete without all its various members. Among⁴
 the gifts named are “faith, working of miracles,
 and gifts of healing.” Please read the whole
 chapter.

 Paul says, “Now concerning spiritual gifts
 brethren, I would not hays you ignorant.” In

 u

  

 SPIRITUAL arm's. 147

 verses 28, 29 and 30, he plainly states that all
 have not the same gifts. Now I understand
 that the possesion of these gifts diﬁers from
 the privilege of all believers to claim the prom-
 ises as given in Mark 16. These are special Δ
 gifts “divided to every man severally as He
 wills.” I understand that those to whom these
 gifts are given are the ones who may use the
 oil, “In the name of the Lord,” as spoken of in
 James 5:14, whether they are ministers or not.
 Please read Eph. 4:11—16. In U and12, other
 gifts are spoken of; 13, “Till we all come in the
 unity of the faith. and of the knowledge of the
 son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meas-
 ure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
 The Church cannot be a perfect body to-day
 without all these gifts, any more than it could
 then. We need all there is in the Gospel
 to keep us from “being carried about with
 every wind of doctrine and cunning craftiness
 whereby they lie in wait to deceive us;" for
 these are the times of “deceivableness.” Truly

 148 BEULAH.

 “perilous times are come” upon the Church of
 God; and every true child of God has great
 need of applying himself diligently to the
 study and daily practice of the grand funda-
 mental doctrines of Christianity; i. e., the four-
 fold Gospel of Christ. These are J ustification,
 Sanctiﬁcation by and through the faith and
 precious blood of Jesus, Divine Healing and
 the Second Coming of Christ.

 In 1 Cor. 13:9, 10, Paul says, “For we know
 in part and we prophesy in part, but when that
 which is perfect is come, that which is in part
 shall be done away.” Here we are told that
 spiritual gifts will be done away when Jesus,
 “that which is perfect is come”. In chapter
 13:2, “Charity” (or Divine Love) is spoken of
 as the greatest of all gifts. Love will go on
 throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. I
 realize more and more, how much divine love
 the Christian needs, to do good work for Jesus;
 more love to God and for all those about us;
 the love of God, not merely human love; ﬁlled

 ,-

 SPIRITUAL arms. 149 _

 with Jesus and His love. It is easy then to
 work for others, doing all in the name of Je-
 sus. In 1 Cor. 14:1, Paul tells the Church to
 “follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts.”
 This does not read much like the oft repeated
 adage, “Miracles ceased with the apostolic age."
 The only object one should have in seeking
 for spiritual gifts is to advance the cause of
 Christ, hasten His coming and bring honor to
 His name by leading the suﬁerers to Him for
 relief, not for our own honor or proﬁt. We
 need to try the spirits to see if they be of God.
 In Acts 20:28-30, Paul warns the Church,
 which Jesus has purchased with His own blood,
 “to be watchful for there shall grievous wolves
 enter in among you, not sparing the ﬂock, also
 of your own selves shall men arise speaking
 perverse things to draw away disciples after
 them." '
 Matt. 24:24: '“For there shall arise false
 Christi: and false prophets and shall show great
 wonders; insonant-,h that if it were possible,

 150 mmmn.

 they shall deceive the very elect.” 2 Thess. 2:3:
 “There will come a falling away before Jesus
 comes.” In verses 8-11, Satan is spoken of as
 being “revealed with all power and signs and
 lying wonders in them that receive not the
 love of the truth, and for this cause God shall
 send them strong delusion." 1 Tim. 6:20, 21:
 Paul says to Timothy, “Keep that which is com-
 mitted to thy trust, avoiding profane and Vain
 babblings and oppositions of science falsely so
 called which some professing have erred con-
 cerning the faith." 1 Tim. 4:1: “Now the
 spirit speaketh exPressly that in the latter
 times some shall depart from the faith giving
 heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.”

 O beloved, let us be among that number that
 “hold faith and a good conscience which some
 having put away concerning faith have made
 shipwreck.” l have been shown no way so true.
 so sure as the way of the cross through the pre-

 ious blood of Jesus. My spirit does not an- ’

 swer to any doctrine that has less of sélf denihl'

 SPIRITUAL ems. 151 -

 less of the cleansing blood of the atonement of
 Christ. This is the way the Word of God
 teaches.

 My soul's constant cry is, that my Father
 will keep me under the cleansing, healing, sav-
 ing and sanctifying blood of Jesus. Amen. ~ ·

 TESTIMONIES.

 HAVING been interested in the Beulah
 Home of Grand Rapids, ever since it was found-
 ed and quite familiar with all of its workings, I
 can truly say that avast amount of good has been
 done through this plan of Gospel Healing. In
 this faith God has revealed Himself to me in a
 wonderful manner. But alas! alas! how many
 long years it has taken me to learn this beau-
 tiful lesson, having made a profession of religion
 for forty-six years. During all this time, I
 suppose 1 have lived as many professed Christ-
 ians have done, and what I now call following
 Jesus afar 0E. Truly much of the time I had

 nsuuonms. .158
 a desire to do good, und even more, lead others
 to Christ. But whenever I attempted todirect
 others to Him, I seemed to lack words. -I had
 not the vital experience. I could notldirect

 t others to the many, many precious promises of

 δ esus because I knew not fully their meaning;
 such as Isa, 26:3: "Thou wilt keep him in per—
 fect peace whose mind is · stayed on The, be-
 cause He :trusteth · in Thee." I thought I Was
 trusting Him, but was it a perfect trust, when
 I ’had never learned that l could fully'place my
 body in His hands for healing, as well as my
 soul for salvation, thereby part of the blessing
 was withheld. both for soul and body. But
 after being repeatedly invited by Sister Grifﬁn
 to attend some of the faith meetings held in
 Grand Rapids, I at last consented'to go. I wm
 more than gratiﬁed with what I heard. and saw.
 Every prayer. Seemed to come from the hoards
 of those who prayed and *as though they ex-

 and earnestness, and the truths were brought
 out in His Word so clearly on the subject, that
 it seemed that no child could help but under-
 stand. I at once began to search for myself,

 attended nearly all the meetings, and so far as _

 others were concerned, believed that it was th'e
 way, but could not see it for myself. Then the
 passage came to my mind, “God is no respectet
 of persons;” and another, “As thy faith‘is, so
 ’be it unto you.” I began to claim the prom-
 ises, as though they were written expressly for
 me, could I then claim them for healing. I ’
 was not sick, had never been tested. Soon af-
 ter this, one very hot day in July, while every
 nerve seemed to be quivering in my body, I
 was preparing to lead a ladies’ prayer meeting
 in the church, when I made the remark that I
 did wish I could get something to take away
 this trembling and nervousness. A young man
 who heard it, quietly replied, “Take it to the
 Lord in prayer," as I had often told him. I -
 felt condemned, and said, “Why not?” This

 set me to thinking. I had been‘much afﬂicted
 with this nervousness, brought on by nervous
 prostration some six years before, and was
 scarcely ever free from it. My head would
 many times tremble so it was perceptible to
 others and embarrassing to myself. One day
 soon after, the Lord seemed to ﬁll my soul with-
 joy, and I was crying unto Him to mold and
 fashion me after His own image, make me a ﬁt
 temple for His own use, when the thought
 came how much this nervousness hindered me
 in the active duties of life, singing, ac. A still
 small voice seemed to whisper, Why not be
 anointed for this? I said, Yes Lord, I will.
 That evening Sister Griliin came to our house.
 I told her l was ready to obey the simple cam-
 mand of being anointed in the name of Jesus,
 according James 5:14 and trust Jesus fully.
 She anointed and prayed with me, and immedi-
 ately all the quivering of the nerves stopped,
 my head ceased to shake, and my soul was full
 of joy and praise. From that time a new ﬁeld

 ever with me; that health and strength were
 purchased for me 1800 years ago, as well as for
 soul salvation, and all I had to do was to reach
 out and take it by faith, how quickly the Lord
 gave me new life, new real! His presence
 seemed to permeate every part of my being; my
 youth was renewed and I felt the force of the
 promises in Isa. 40:29—31. I also found that

 more faithful Church work, but I have attend-
 - ed nearly all the meetings at Beulah, when I
 was in the city, besides many evening faith
 meetings in different parts of the city; never
 enjoyed any work better, and while absent this
 summer in the Northern Peninsula, had the
 privilege of presenting this glorious truth, and
 the grand work of the Beulah Home to many
 different ones who became interested. One
 dear sister, Mrs. George Bedell of Hancock,
 wu wonderfully helped in answer to prayer;
 had not walked without a cane for six months

 ' and was taking medicine all the time for acom-

 plication of diseases, laid it all aside, and also
 her cane, walked forth quite comfortably in
 the name of Jesus; afterward came to Beulah
 and received great beneﬁt, both spiritually and
 physically. My constant prayer is that Christ-
 ians will awake up to this blessed privilege and
 better way of serving God.

 “O God, my God Ῐ cried unto Thee and thou
 hast healed me.” ’ -

 I have felt for some time that I should bring
 ‘my healing, which was in answer to prayer,
 before the public and I gladly accept this op-
 ‘portunity of doing so. [earnestly pray that
 my testimony may be used of the dear Lord in
 bringing many suﬁering ones to trust‘in His
 promise as given in James 5:14, 15. .

 From my‘early childhootl I have-been troub-
 led ‘with a skin disease, of one of the "worst
 forms. By some of the physicians it was call-
 ed a species of leprousy. I have been treated
 by some of the best physicians in the state.
 [ took mineral baths for two years, but no cum
 was affected. I only received a. temporal relief.
 Each time it took on a worse form; and for the
 last six years Ihave never been free from it.
 -How I have suﬁerea, God and myself only
 know. For no one can possibly imagine my-
 thing about it. At times the itching and
 burning were terrible; and my nervous system

 ras'mmmas. 161
 became so Weakened that for weeks I feared for
 f my reason. I could not sleep as I could not en-
 dure the warmth of the bed, or the heat of the
 stove; and when I went into a cool room, ner-
 vous chills would seize me. In this way *I put
 in long days and still longer nights. Was it
 any wonderI feared for my reason? At this
 time a friend said tome, “Why don’t you trust
 in Jesus for the healing of your body ?” It
 was a new thought to me, and I could not un-

 derstand how to do so, and I thought no more ’

 of it. I continued to grow worse all the time,
 until I was literally covered with the loathe-
 some disease. I don’t think one could put
 hi ﬁnger on .my person from the crown of
 my head to my feet that was not covered with
 sores and White scales. I was so weak that I
 could scarcely walk across the ﬂoor. I gener—
 ally rested on a couch away from the ﬁre.

 One physician who had treated me for two
 years (and during that time had removed a tu-
 mor from the top of my head) in whom I had

 162 manum.
 perfect confidence as a physician, told me -that
 he had done all that could be done, and that
 it was not in the power of man to cure me; I
 could_'only receive temporary relief at the most.

 He also said that if I lived long enough, the “
 ﬂesh would undoubtedly drop oﬁ my bones.

 For years I had suﬁered greatly with sciatic
 rheumatism so at times I was almost helpless.
 I had taken strong medicines every hour; my
 stomach became so weakened that it seemed
 I that every dose would burn it through. Then
 I began to cry mightily unto the Lord asking
 Him what I should do, for I did ’not feel that
 I could live much longer in this way if I did
 not get relief. Then the thought again came
 to me, Why don’t you trust in Jesus for your ’
 healing. I said at once, The Lord helping me,
 I will. I then said to my husband, “I have
 taken my lmt dose of medicine. I will give my-
 self to the Lord, and if I live I will live to glo-
 rify Him, and if I die, I will die rejoicing in
 His Holy name."

 This was Feb. 22nd, and on the 23rd he went
 with me to “Beulah.” Thank God for “Beulah.”
 We had six miles to ride, but I told him I
 knew that the» Lord would give me strength i
 to go; and-- He did, praise His holy name. I
 gave my soul and body, sin-sick and sore to the
 Lord and He healed me. I received the anoint-
 ing by Mrs. Griﬁin and after making a public
 consecration of my entire beingto the Lord (at
 the faith prayer meeting held at “Beulah” the
 same day) I requested united prayers for my
 recovery. The dear Heavenly Father did hear
 and answer our prayers just then; for I was in-
 stantly relieved from all suffering. All the
 pain and stiffness caused from the rheumatism;
 all the itching and burning caused from the
 leprousy was instantly taken away. My soul
 was ﬁlled with praises and rejoicing to my lov-
 ing Savior for His kindness toward me. I rode
 home that night with the most perfect ease,
 for I felt that the Lord was giving strength to
 my body all the way.

 I reached home. not feeling a bit tired. I
 prepared the tea, ate a hearty supper, washed
 the tea dishes, then sat down by the stove and
 warmed. without any itching or burning. Be-
 fore retiring, I brushed from my body more
 than a dust-pan full of scabs. I went to ,bed
 and slept well all night, and have not lost a
 night’s sleep since. Next morning l arose and
 did a two-weeks' washing, a thing I had not
 done for years before. All the sores, scales
 and eruptions left my body, and my skin be-
 eame as fresh and smooth as a child's. I have
 had perfect health since. We live on a farm
 and I have done all my own work including
 washing and ironing ever since. I had been
 able to do very little before this. ,

 O how my heart rejoices that I have found
 such a Savior and Physician; one who is ready
 to heal all who trust in Him.

 Satan has been permitted to test my faith a
 little at times; but I do not fear, forI know
 in whom I trust.

 The symptoms of leprousy have shown them-
 selves on my face, but it has been a'tteuded with
 no suﬁering but once, and that was relieved in-

 stantly in answer to prayer. I know that the .

 Father has some wise purpose in thus trying
 me for a little season, and I know that when 1
 learn the lessons He wishes to teach me, He
 will remove every trace» of Satan’s marks. I
 will trust Him, though He slay me; l will sing
 praises unto Him w long as I have breath.

 Mns, In! A. Fumus.

 In honor to my blessed Healer, I love to tell
 a little of the story of His wonderful dealings
 with we. Since I was ﬁfteen years of-age, I
 have believed in and practiced the hygienic way

 166 mm.

 of treating diseases; also the graham bread sys-
 tem, discarding pork in every form. We lived
 in this way for over twenty years, and never
 once had occasion to call a physician. After
 this, almost imperceptibly,-we lost sight of our
 simple manner of living, became careless, and
 fell into many doubtful ways ‚of worldly living.

 At this time we lived in a low malarious dis-
 trict for many years, where we contracted ea-
 tarrh, liver trouble, and many other diseases,
 growing therefrom. .

 However, during thirty-three years of exper-
 ience in raising a. large family of children, we
 have never called a physician but seven times,
 and that was to diagnose the disease, We then
 laid aside all medicines and resorted to the wa-
 ter cure. After coming to the city, I had a
 very severe cough. My friends urged my
 speedy use of “Shilo’s “ Consumption Cure,”
 which, 1 did. I abandoned it however before
 using one vial, as I found that it injured rath*

 . er than helped me. .

  

 rasrmomns. 167

 I rapidly failed in strength so that I began
 to think seriously of leaving my family. I felt
 that I had but little choice in the matter, but I
 went to the Lord· and entreated Him if it was
 consistent with His will, to heal me. on my
 children's account. He heard my prayer and
 took away my cough.

 For over six years I had liver complaint
 which at times was very troublesome. Had
 much pain between my shoulders and in my
 stomach, with frequent attacks of bilious colic,
 my complexion became sallow and my eyes in-
 ﬂamed and swollen. I again began to fear for
 my life. Providentially, I heard of Mrs. Grif-
 ﬁn’s Faith prayer meetings which I attended
 and in which I became very much interested.
 All that I heard. seemed to encourage my faith
 to believe that the Lord was the Healer of His
 people. I also saw many miracles wrought in an-
 swer to “the prayer of faith." l soon accepted
 Jesus as the Physician of my body, received the
 anointing with the oﬁering of the “prayer of

 168 nnuma.

 faith” by Mrs. Griﬂin. I was immediately
 healed, for since that time I have not had one
 symptom of my old diseases, but instead,
 health and vigor. My eyes were so bad that I
 had been obliged to wear glasses for seven years
 and then suffered pain Very often from them.
 I thought of being anointed for this also, but
 one morning after being out on an errand for
 the Lord in which I became wonderfully bless-
 ed and strengthened, I returned home, took up
 a newspaper of ﬁne print and read very easily
 without any glasses. Praise the Lord, for He
 says, “before they call I will answer."

 To me all the “words of life” have a new
 meaning; and beauties keep unfolding them-
 selves to my mind and soul every day. I am
 so free from bodily ailments of all kinds, that
 like Paul,- I scarcely know “whether I am in
 the body or out.” Every sickness that has en-
 tered my home for the past year has received
 the laying on of hands, with prayer in Jesus’
 name, we claim the promise that “these signs

 mammonas. 169

 shall follow them that believe," and they do.
 I forego all else for this glorious experience,
 and entreat all suﬁering ones to seek Him that
 “turneth the shadow of death into health and
 gladness.”

 I have seen this done time and again. “Lo
 all these things worketh God often times with
 man.” Job 33:28.. Please read 12——33. .

 God’s Word declares, “my people are destroy-
 ed for lack of knowledge.” Not the knowledge
 or wisdom of this world for that is foolishness
 with God. It is that knowledge of Him “whom

 to know aright is life eternal.” “There is a .

 way that seemeth right unto man, but the end
 thereof is death.” Listen to the Word of God:
 “For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is incur-
 able,- and thy wound is grievous. There is
 none to plead thy cause that thou mayst be
 bound up; thou hast no healing medicines."
 Jer. 30:12, 13. “I wound and I heal: neither
 is there any that can deliver out of my hand."
 Dent. 32:39. “I will ransom them from the

 170 Barman. ’
 power of the grave; J will redeem them from
 death.” Hosea 13:14. “Heal me, O Lord and
 I shall be healed; save me and J shall be saved;
 for thou art my praise.” Jer. 17:14. All
 glory be to the faithful and merciful Father,
 the victorious Savior, and blessed Comforter,
 the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

 I wish to testify to the glory of God of my

 sick headache I attended a faith meeting
 held at Mrs. Coryell’s having at the time a very

 With a heart ﬁlled with gratitude to my kind
 Heavenly Father for my restoration to health
 I write this testimony. '

 When about fourteen years of age I gave my
 heart to God. I lived in a j ustiﬁed state about
 eight years, and had many happy hours with
 Jesus. I then began to feel the need of a.
 deeper work of grace, for l was beeomingmnre
 and more conscious of pride, evil temperand a
 man-fearing spirit. I began to realize also
 that if the Son of Man should come in an hour
 when I thought not, I would not be prepared
 and ready to meet Him. I knew that the Word
 of God says, “Without holiness no man shall
 see the Lord;” also “Blessed are the purein
 heart for they shall see God.” _

 I went upon my knees before the Lord; made
 a complete consecration and gave my all to
 Christ, and through faith I received the bless-
 ing. I knew then by personal experience that
 this was the will of God even my sanetifica-
 tion, bless His name. My'soul was ﬁlled with

 172 . BEULAE. -

 praises, peace and joy unspeakable; and I was
 enabled to have perfect victory over the “world
 the ﬂesh and the devil." Glory to His name
 forever. God then called me to work for Him
 and the salvation of souls; and I was enabled

 to say in my heart, I will do anything for Je- 7

 sus and not fear; anywhere for Jesus be it far

 or near. Α ,
 Soon after this I was called to leave home and

 friends, and went to London, Canada, with the

 determination to live or die for the salvation -

 of souls. God wonderfully blessed my labors
 while in the Work, but I was seized with a dis-
 ease which the doctors called catarrh sore
 throat. I lost my voice and at times I was not
 able to speak above a whisper. Before this I
 had a very strong voice, and took great pleas-
 ure in talking and singing for Jesus. It was a
 comfort to me to know that Jesus knew all
 about it. I went to see ﬁve doctors but they
 gave me very little encouragement. One of
 them said that I Was almost dead with catal-rh.

 About this time I heard of Mrs. Grifﬁn and
 was led to go and see her. After she had

 ’ she was yet praying for the healing of my
 throat, the prayer was answered, for God touch-

 For over seven years I had been a great suf-

 ferer from diseases common to females, and my
 husband took me from one place to another to

 receive treatment. At last I came to Grand

 faith. · I gave myself to the Lord, and received
 the anointing with prayer for my healing, and
 I'can now say to the glory of God, that I am

 I used to have very severe attacks of sick
 headache, which would come upon me every
 two or three weeks causing me great distress;
 but the dear Lord-has taken them away.

 I also suﬁered much from rheumatism, but
 my Sickness Bearer has borne this away. I
 sometimes have symptoms of all these diseases,
 but I give them all over into the hands of Je-

 - sus, and they pass away without sickness fol-

 lowing. One day I burnt my hand so badly,
 that the skin puffed way out, and instead of ap-
 plying something to remove the pain and burn,
 I gave it to Jesus to heal. Immediately the

 swelling all went down, and the pain and sore-
 hess disappeared; and in a few minutes I scarce-
 ly knew that I had burned me. I ﬁnd that it
 pays to trust Jesus with both soul and body,
 for I never imagined such great spiritual bless-
 ings could come to me, as I have received since
 coming to Jesus for physical healing.

 In 1883, June 16th, I was travelling in Iowa.
 The train I was on was about forty miles west
 of Dubuque, going at the rate of 35 or 40 miles
 per hour, when we were struck by a cyclone. ”
 Three of the cars were carried above the tree-
 tops aud came to the ground a perfect wreck
 about eleven rods from the place from which
 they were taken up. My injuries were very se-
 vere. I was so badly cut open that my bowels
 came out. Was carried to a hotel where
 I received good care and medical treatment.
 Finally. I was sent to a hospital in St. Paul,

  

 rasrmomns. 177
 Minn, where I remained thirteen months.
 While there I recovered so that I could be up
 and around some, although I suﬁered continu-
 ally from hemorrhage of the bowels. Would
 often bleed until my strength was almost-gone.
 I went to Grand Rapids, Mich, where I again
 consulted physicians, who told me that there
 was no help for me unless I had an operation
 and that might prove fatal. Before this took
 place, ·Ι heard of the Faith Prayer Meetings
 being held in the city by Mrs. Gräﬁn. I was
 led to attend the Dedication of the “Beulah”
 Rest in February and also an especial meeting
 which was held the morning after for some
 who wished to receive the anointing. I was a
 Christian but was in a very cold state, and as I
 heard the blessed truth there in regard to full
 and free salvation for both soul and body, I re-
 alized as I never before had, the importance ’of
 being wholly the Lord’s, and getting where I
 could believe His Word, and trust His. power '
 alone to‘ deliver both soul and body. Accord-

 178 ' manum,
 ingly 1 give myself anew to God to be ﬁlled
 with His life and love and pOWer. I received
 the anointing and had prayer offered for my re-
 covery. Immediately I was conscious of the
 healing power of Jesus in both soul and .body.
 Glory be to His Name. The pain, soreness,
 aud hemorrhage entirely left my body and I
 felt a mighty baptism of the spirit ﬁlling my
 soul with joy unspeakable and full of glory. I
 can truly say that my Hallowed Lord hath
 wrought a perfect cure for I have never since
 bum troubled with the injuries I received in
 f that cyclone.

 After thisl went to Fort Wayne, Ind., where
 l was suddenly seized with a stroke of paral-
 ysis. They thought I was going to die, and
 sent for my children living in Chicago. They
 came and insisted upon my having adoetor,
 but I told them no, I could not as I was look-
 ing to Jesus to heal me. q After my faith was
 severely tested for a few days, I was raised up
 in answer to United prayer offered at “Beulah”

 rssnnonms. 179
 for me. I was well again until the summer
 following, when our city was visited by a ma-
 lignant form of typhoid fever, which for some
 .time carried oﬂf from twenty to twenty—four
 each week. I was stricken down with the
 same fever, with which I was sick eighteen
 days. I was brought right down to death's
 door. I sent word to “Beulsh” of my illness

 and requested prayers for my recovery. Just ·

 as soon as Mrs. Griﬂin received my request, she
 yelled the family together and prayed forme,
 and at that very hour the fever left me and I
 fell into a sweet sleep. I awoke free, and soon
 gained my strength so that I could go about
 my usual work again. The great spiritual .
 blessings that have been givenme since I gave
 my body to the Lord are more than Ι can ex-
 press. In a.ll my many trials and tests, my
 soul has been kept in perfect peace. And I ﬁnd
 such ai delightful rest and joy in being able to
 trust in the “living God." S. A. PLUMMER.

 To glorify God as Imust, I will testify to
 the healing of my body in November last. I
 began to be ill in October and kept getting
 worse until in November was taken down to-
 my bed with inﬂammation and only with the
 greatest eﬁort could I move. The pain and
 soreness became so great that I could not move
 without screaming. I sent for a physician but
 he did me no good. At last [sent for Sister Grif-
 ﬁn. She came and Sister Blakeney with her.
 They prayed with me, laid hands on me in the
 name bf Jesus and bade the enemy leave. The
 pain left immediately and I very soon got up.
 After awhile I laid down and had a sweet sleep,

 ’ then arose, went upstairs to bed. Next morn-
 ing I went about my work as usual. The
 pain would return but I would bid it leave in
 the name of Jesus, and told the enemy that I
 was healed, and it soon left and I have been
 well ever since and have not taken a drop of
 medicine. Praise His blessed name. Yes,
 Praise the Lord. The blessing we get ivl heal-

 each day. My appetite has kept pace with my
 increasing strength, and some of my friends
 hardly knew me because of my changed ap-
 pearance. The old symptoms of disease have
 all disappeared and I am nOW so strong that I
 can walk miles without fatigue. Many of my
 friends are convinced of the reality of “Divine
 Healing," and some of the young people have
 embraced the faith.

 A short time since, while I was out riding
 with a lady and gentleman, the horse ran away
 and threw me out in such a way as to injure my
 wrist and arm badly. The gentleman said,

 most heartily, “Yes, ten times better.”

 pany during which time I was in the habit of
 frequenting saloons. One night I remained
 longer than usual and came out under the in·
 ﬂuence of liquor. I said aloud' to myself as I
 came out, that if I was ever guilty of entering

 ’ that place again, I hoped God would strike me

 blind. In about a week I went back to the sa-
 loon, where the curse of God in answer to my
 request rested upon me. Soon after this, in
 December, my eyes began to trouble me and

 by June I was totally blind. The very best ἱ

 medical skill was employed for their restoration.
 1 consulted Prof. Frothingham of Ann Arbor,
 Dr. Lunday of Detroit, C. W. Agnew and Web-
 ster of New York City. All decided that no
 medical skill could reach my case as a tumor
 had formed at the base of my brain. In about
 a year I began to have spasms at intervals; these
 kept increasing upon me so that l would have
 a number each day. At one time I had ﬁfteen
 in two days. I had had these for about two
 years, when a lady called to see me, and told

 Tns'mroxrns. 185

 me that they were holding Faith Prayer Meet-
 ings in the city, and asked me if 1 would not
 like to be remembered in prayer. After this,
 Mm. Hunter, wife of the City Missionary, and
 Mrs. Dora Grifﬁn called to see me. Before
 leaving, they asked if they might pray with me.
 I told them that I did not suppose it Would do
 ’ any harm. They asked me to kneel with them.
 I was very ignorant as to what that meant but
 did the best I knew how, by getting up into a
 chair on my knees. They told me that was
 not the way, and I laughingly inquired what I
 should do then. They told me to get down up-
 on the ﬂoor on my knees. I did so, and they
 ,prayed that God might have mercy upon me
 and undertake my ease· for me. They kindly
 invited me to attend some of the prayer meet-
 ings. I told them that ifI came I would have
 to bring along some medicine to take, or I -
 might have a. spasm in meeting. Mrs. Griﬂin
 told me to leave my medicine ail: home for the
 ‚Lord would takeoareofme. Soon after this I

 186 *mmmm

 took a dose of medicine and started for meeting.
 This was the last medicine I took. I was fully
 convinced that my soul was in as great need as
 my body, and made up my mind to give myself

 soul and body, to the Lord, which I did at the ι

 next meeting. At the second meeting I receiv-.
 ed the anointing thus giving myself in holy
 covenant to God. He accepted me, unworthy
 as I was. My physical improvement was very
 marked. I have had but one spasm since that
 time, and that lasted me about thirty minutes,
 Soon after this I united with the Church and
 haye been walking ever since with the light of
 God Within my soul, although as yet my sight
 has not been restored; but still am strong in
 the faith that God can and will return it to me,
 when He sees that I am ready to be trusted
 with it, and can use it alone for His glory.

 I had been suffering with a very bad cough
 ’ for over a year, which was attended with all
 the symptoms of consumption. My attending
 physician examined my lungs and found a. large
 cavity in one. I steadily grew worse under all
 medical treatment. The doctor said that there
 was no use of my taking medicine, as it did not
 reach my case at all, and I had about given up
 the thoughts of being helped. One day one of
 my friends brought Mrs. Dora. G. Grifﬁn in to q
 see me. I was a professing Christian, but had
 fallen into a very cold and formal state, with
 which I was much dissatisﬁed. Mrs. Griﬂin
 opened up to me some of the steps in the life
 of faith, and clearly showed me the glorious
 provisions made in the Gospel of Christ for the
 healing of the body as well as the soul. My
 hungry soul drank in the wondrous revelation,
 and at once I gave myself in a new covenant
 to the Lord and received the anointing; prayer
 was oﬁered for my recovery. _
 Immediately I commenced gaining strength

 and ﬂesh and in a very short time the pain and
 soreness in my lungs, with all consumptive ’
 symptoms left me. Again my lungs were ex—
 amined and were found to be perfectlywell and
 in a good healthy condition.

 Shortly after this I was suddenly seized with
 a very violent form of typhus fever, which de-
 ranged my mind for several days. When I felt
 the disease coming on I told my husband not
 to send for a doctor as I was trusting the Great
 Physician, and I knew He would bring me
 through all right. My faith was severely test-
 ed, however, for a number of days; when, sud-
 denly all the disease and every symptom of it
 was removed, insomuch that I got up and went
 about my work as usual. '

 Satan is sometimes permitted to touch my
 body with Severe neuralgia pains; as this is a
 chronic trouble of mine, but 1, at once, ﬂee
 my new found Physician and He gives relief.

 For a number ofyears before I gave my body
 to the Lord I was obliged to wear glasses, my

 eyes being so weak I could not read without ι

 them. I did not think to ask the Lord to un-
 dertake for my eyes also, so I felt doubly re-
 joiced when I found the dear Lord had done
 more for me than I could “ask or think.” He

 so wonderfully healed my eyes when the other ,

 work was wrought that I have had no need-for
 my glasses since. My faith was tested a short
 time since, however. One of my former troub-
 les, inﬂammation in· the eyes, set in and was
 very bad, and painful. One eye swelled, while
 the water ran from it continually. A number
 of my good neighbors were on hand with their
 salve, eye-water, 850., Which was a “sure cure;"

 ’ but l told them all, No, I would trust the Lord

 to heal me. Some of them seemed quite indig-
 nant with my unreasonableness in suﬁering so
 much when they thought I might use some lit-
 tle remedy and cure myself. it came prayer

 worse. I told him that I should go, and trust ’
 Jesus to take care of my eyes, as I felt that He

 wanted me in the meeting to help with my

 presence and my prayers. I went. The dear

 Lord was there, and we had a good time; but

 my eyes kept paining me while one of them ran

 a perfect stream of water; still I was not dis-

 couraged but was looking for the healing to

 come any moment. After the meeting had

 closed, and I was just ready to start for home,.
 Jesus touched my eyes, the pain and soreness

 went in a moment and the water did not run

 another drop after that. Oh, how -I praised

 the dear Lord for His wonderful deliverance.

 Icannot begin to tell all about the spiritual

 quickenings I have received in connection with

 these wonderful physical healings.

 Since I have been enabled to consecrate my
 entire being to God and His service, I have
 found a real willingness to become anything or
 nothing for Jesus’ sake, only that I may be

 joy and triumph that I never experienced be-
 fore, so I am encouraged to press on. Some
 time after I was healed, I stepped through a
 trap door, falling at distance of six feet, strik-
 ing my right side on the opposite side of the
 stairway and breaking one of my ribs. I struck
 upon my feet, one upon the celler bottom, the
 other upon the ﬁrst step, giving my whole sys-
 η tern a terrible shock and causing much. inter-
 nal pain. I gave all into the hands of Jesus,
 realizing His power to heal bones as well as to
 make them, praising Him that my life was
 spared. In less than three weeks I was healed
 of all effects of the injury. Prayer was the
 only means used for my recovery

 I cannot perfectly describe my case to any-
 one, it was so very peculiar. My health was

 “ rasrnmnms. 193

 wrecked at the age of nineteen in the midst of ’
 my school studies, and I was set aside as a hope-
 less invalid. I cried to God for help and was
 partially restored; but advancing years and cli-
 matic exposures culminated in serious troubles.
 After a long siege of inﬂammatory diseases, I
 again learned to walk seventeen years ago,
 but was ever after very feeble and subject to
 violent attacks which constantly menaced my
 life.

 No one ever had kinder or more interested"
 medical treatment, for which I shall never
 cease to be thankful. Three years ago I was
 taken south; while there I had mountain air,
 healing water and highest medical skill. Un- ‹
 der these inﬂuences, 1 improved much and re-
 turned to my home with high hopes. These
 hopes ended in bitter disappointment. My
 physician then told me the principal disease,
 located in my stomach was untouched, giving

 it as his opinion that the tissue of my st0mach

 inﬂammation and could neverbe restored. About
 this time I was told that there was to be a faith
 prayer meeting held near, by Mrs. Dora Griﬂin '
 of Grand Rapids. l was prayed for at the
 meeting. Although I was very weak yet my
 dear friend Mrs. Edwards insisted on my being'

 · taken to see Mrs. Grifﬁn next day. Partly out

 of respect for her I decided to go. I went not

 ⁷ to argue but to learn; yet I had some opinions

 of my own and many doubts, which could not
 have been removed with anything less than a
 “thus saith the Lord.” Mrs. Grifﬁn’s presence,
 the look of joyful conﬁdence in her face and
 the practical acceptance of God’s Word and
 promises which she taught, stirred my inmost
 soul. God-given faith breathed within me, as
 I began more fully to realize that “all things
 are possible to Him that believeth.”

 Eighteen years ago while husband was read-
 ing at my bedside the beautiful 103rd Psalm,
 “W ho forgiveth all mine iniquilies, and healeth
 all my diseases.” the Spirit whispered, Why not

 TESTIMONIES. 195

 claim both promises? Oh, how frightfully
 blind I was! At another time when I was great-
 ly discouraged I opened the Bible and read
 these words: “Thou shalt not die but live and
 declare the glory of God.” After all these
 years of painful waiting and suﬁering, I was at
 last brought to face these glorious promises
 ccncerning bodily healing. I gave my case in-
 to the hands of the Great Healer, and oh, how
 gracious He was unto me..

 After the anointing by Mrs. Grifﬁn and dur-
 ing our united prayer, and while her hand was
 still upon me felt a strange warmth creep
 through my stomach and a thrill of joy through-
 out my entire being, soul and body. I cannot
 describe the sensation any more than I could
 _wy conversion; but the witness of the Spirit
 was mine that I was healed. The woman that
 touched the hem of Jesus’ garment was no

 happier than I. I went home, embraced each r

 one of my family, and told them what great
 things the Lord had done for me. My daug-

 ter Grace said, “Telegraph it to E- and A-,’⁷
 (our children at college.) This staggered my
 faith a little and I thought we had better wait
 and see if this held out. I helped do the even-
 ing’s work and went to bed so happy that I
 could not sleep. During the night, the tempt-
 er came as never before. All my pains return-
 ed intensiﬁed with mental suffering. Oh, such
 a night of agony! I continued to pray as best
 I could. In the morning I said but little, but
 requested them to take me to Mrs. Grifﬁn again.
 I continued praying all the time and we had
 . gone but a short distance when 10, greater joy
 than ever before, came to me and all pain and
 distress dissappeared immediately. Subsequent
 to this I have had afew attacks from the ene—
 my but these have all vanished, and I can say
 ,to the praise of God, I am “every whit whole“.

 ease had almost paralyzed my bowels the ter-

 tions- and have performed them ever since.

 For several years I was a. great suﬁerer from
 hemorrhoids; but the dear Lord heard me for
 this also.

 About four weeks after my healing deep
 sores broke out on my face. I said “these feel
 just as my stomach used to feel”; and I believe
 now they were the natural channel through
 which the Lord was pleased to cleanse me. l
 have only spoken of the minor things, but
 sufﬁce it to say, the numerous diseases which
 were of many years’ standing have wholly dis-
 appeared. I had long been desiring a nearness
 to Christ and this came with the physical heal-
 ing. I can truly say, I walked and talked with
 Him. ' ’Twas heaven to my soul. His Spirit
 brought His words to my mind just as Jesus
 said He would. When I- felt discouraged He
 comforted me. _

 I thought my healing would almost revolu-
 tionize our town. I would tell everybody of
 our wonderful Savior and they would believe.

 In this I was greatly disappointed. Even those
 who were sent to comfort and instruct God’s
 people, publicly opposed this part of the G03-
 pel of Christ. I sometimes was made to feel
 that much of our professed Christianity, was
 but as a little superﬁcial growth under which
 lay the deep, broad, hard rock of unbelief; in
 fact that the earth fairly re-echoed with unbe-
 lief. ·

 Healed through faith, Praise God for it.

 When'I was twelve years of age I felt the ”
 need of a new heart. I asked God for it and
 He gave it to me. I am now forty-six years
 old and oh, how wonderfully the Lord has led
 me. I must say there is nothing so grand and
 glorious_as to know we are of God’s chosen
 ones. When I came to Grand Rapids ﬁve years
 ago I became acquainted with S. B. Shaw,
 (President of the Michigan Holiness Associa-
 tion,) and his very Worthy wife. I saw them
 live by faith alone for' all things, both spirit-

 Δ ual and temporal; and of them I learned how

 to consecrate myself wholly unto the Lord.

 I had been aﬁlicted with rheumatism from
 a child; and had spent large sums of money for
 my recovery but could only ﬁnd relief for a few
 weeks at a time. I was sick and helpless in bed
 with inﬂammatory rheumatism, when I heard
 through Mrs. Shaw of Mrs. Dora Grillin. I
 sent for her to anoint me; after she had done
 so and while she was praying for my recovery,

 200 ' mum

 the Lord touched my· body and I was healed
 that very same hour and have never been
 troubled with it since, praise God. One year
 after this, the piles came upon me, and I suf-
 fez-ed greatly with this. After trying many ·
 remedies 'and doctors without relief, I said, The ·
 Lord has healed me and He will heal me again; '
 so I Went to the “Beulah” rest and after prayer
 and anointing I was healed and went home ·

 I was left with a cough after having measles
 over twenty years ago, which has troubled me
 more or less every winter since. Twelve years

 ago, ulcers began to form, and then healed over
 so they -did not trouble me much, until nearly
 two years ago, they again began to form and
 were very painful. This was accompanied with
 night SWeats, chills and fever which reduced
 me very rapidly notwithstanding all my med-
 ical treatment. My attending physician, Dr.
 Botsford, of Grand Rapids, pronounced my dis-
 ease beyond the cure of all human remedies,
 and told me to settle all my aﬁairs as my end
 was only a matter of a very short time, unless
 I obtained speedy relief through the prayer of
 Faith, or Metaphysical treatment.

 I at once Sent out for Mrs. Grifﬁn who was
 holding meetings near by. She soon called to
 see me, and asked me if J was willing to lay
 aside all remedies and trust Jesus to cure me. I
 thought at ﬁrst I could‘ only trust Him to bless
 the means used. Then the question was put,
 “Should you recover, to Whom would you give
 the glory?” I replied, “Why Jesus of course.”
 “No,” said Mrs. Grifﬁn, “God is a jealous God,

 202 BEULAH.
 and will not divide His glory with another."
 Before leaving, Mrs. Griﬁin offered earnest
 prayer that I might be enabled to lay aside all
 human helps and trust Jesus alone. After
 much meditation on the promises of God 1 con-
 cluded that it would be best and safest to com-
 mit my case wholly into the hands of God and
 trust Him to work it out for me. From Mrs.
 Grifﬁn’s ﬁrst call, on Wednesday, I seemed
 much better in many ways until Saturday when
 I was taken with severe bloating and hard
 breathing, which lasted me into Sunday. 1

 of days. I
 On Thursday I was again seized with symp-
 toms, much worse than any I had before. Fri-
 day 1 sent for Dr. Botsford to satisfy himself
 as to my condition, and when he asked if he

 TESTIMONIES. 203

 should leave any remedies, 1 told him· “No.”
 On leaving the house, he told some he met out—
 side the door that [ could not possibly last only
 a little while. [steadily grew worse. Satur-
 day they did not think I would live through
 the day; but united prayer was again offered by
 Mrs. Grifﬁn and Rev. E. R. Bennett, after
 which I was immediately relieved, and began
 to realize the healing power of God in my lungs
 and coursing throughout my entire body, which
 was very invigorating. That same night God
 revealed to me in a dream or vision, I can
 scarcely tell which, a perfect grain of mustard
 seed, and a great mountain. Then He showed
 me that my faith must become as perfect and
 large as that little seed, before I could remove
 the mountain. While looking at the tiny seed,
 all at once I put out my hand and the moun-
 tain disappeared, and I commenced rising, but
 something seemed to hold me, a little thread
 was not yet cut. The Spirit applied the lesson
 of Abraham in his perfect consecration, oﬂer-

 204 BEULAH.

 ing Isaac. While contemplating this wonder-
 ful trust, the thread that bound me gave way,
 and I arose, and soared away, away, into a most
 delightful atmosphere. I awoke very happy,
 and with the full assurance of faith that I
 would be healed. I aroused my husband to tell
 him what I had experienced and that I was go-
 ing to recover, and that Satan should not have
 the victory, nor man the praise, but God should
 have the glory. From that time my recovery
 was very rapid, and in less than tWO months
 from this time I was doing most of my house-
 work again. At the time of my healing, I felt
 a prickly sensation in and about a large cavity
 in my lung caused fr‘om ulcers. Since that,
 my lung has formed and ﬁlled out so my chest
 is as full on that side as the other.

 II? the fall of the same year, from overwork,
 I brought on a nervous prostration, from which
 I suﬁered for some little time, but was restored
 after anointing and prayer.

 Again in February, I was taken with ery-

 TESTIMONIES. 205

 sipelas in the face, which lasted in all about one
 Week. My face was badly swollen and much
 discolored, but a few days after anointing and
 prayer the disease entirely disappeared, praise
 the Lord.

 Again I did my own work until June, when
 I felt very much in need of a rest and change
 which I took for about six weeks in the name
 of Jesus; then came home feeling much strong-
 er in every way.

 Satan is sometimes permitted to touch my
 body in diﬂerent ways and at one or two times
 I haye been tempted to take herb tea for mala-

 that it made me worse rather than better. Thus
 I have found that it is safer to trust in the
 Lord alone, for the relief of little ailments than
 to even listen to the enemy as he comes whis-
 ’ pering ar'ound with his little prescriptions,
 tempting us into the betrayal of'our trust in
 the One Great Physician. My spiritual exper-

 to move herself forward in her chair, and to
 move her feet a little. After her return she
 continued to improve slowly for some time,
 when she had a sickness which caused her much
 suﬁering and rendered her more helpless, al-
 most entirely losing the use of her left hand
 and arm. Her trust was sweet in Jesus through
 it all. She felt that if she could come to “Ben-
 lah” again she would be healed.

 Soon after coming, she was obliged to
 change attendants, which caused her anxiety
 and seemed to hinder the work some. She im-
 proved about as she did the ﬁrst time, her faith
 taking hold anew. When her husband came
 for her it stormed a little and was cold. We

 DEAR Mas. GRIFFIN: I have been so busy
 mending since my return, that I could not ﬁnd
 time to write. We had a serious time getting
 home. The storm came on before we left the
 city. It was in our faces all the way. The
 horses’ eyes were full of ice so that they could
 not keep the road. Mr. Critchlow’s face and
 eyes were all ice so that he could not see. The
 horses stepped off into a culvert and threw me
 out and my chair upon me; still the sleigh did
 not upset. I don’t know what we would have
 done without Walter. He had to get out sev-
 eral times to see where the road was, and we
 would be going off a bridge or down an embank-
 ment. we drove through snow-drifts as high
 as the horses’ backs. We were three miles from
 home when- I fell out, and the rest of the way
 I lay in the bottom of the sleigh. My wrap-
 pings were all oi! but my shawl; still I did not
 get very cold, only my face where the sleet cut
 it. My veil was OE and all ice. I was pray-

 ing all the way when I saw the danger. I was
 very sore for a few days, but it is all gone now,
 and the Lord has preserved me awhile for my

 an improvement. Remember me in your pray-

 will deliver me in His own time.

 Cannonsburgh, Mich., Jan. 18th, 1888.

  

 DEAR SISTER: I am so glad of the privilege
 of telling others what the Lord has done for my
 soul and body. Oh, that pen could tell it in
 such a way that those who read might also be
 led to seek the Great Physician! When a child
 I learned to read God’s Word. I have wonder-
 ed why Christians, at least, should think it nec-
 essary to seek help from any other source. The
 command in James 5:14 seemed so plain that I
 could not be satisﬁed with the explanation
 that the day of His compassion toward us was
 passed. So that when in January, 1887, I at-

 210 mamm.

 tended the faith meeting in the city of Grand
 Rapids, and there saw those on whom the Di-
 vine Healer had laid His hand, dear suﬁering
 ones restored to health and hope. I too, long-
 ed to touch but the “hem of His garment,”

 that I might be"‘made whole." I⁸ gladly ac- .

 cepted the oﬁered invitation to receive the
 anointing for my body, and kneeling then and
 there, devoutly consecrated myself to God.
 What that meant to me words cannot tell. in
 a few days I returned to my home, taking with
 me a large package of tracts and books on the
 subject of Divine Healing. It immediately
 occurred to me that the Lord was just m able
 to give strength and restoration to dim and
 weak eyes, if one could conﬁde in His tender
 love and faithful promises, and lay aside eye-
 glasses, as He could heal the diseased and tar-
 tared limbs when crutches were laid down, and
 the lame were made to leap for joy. Satan
 failed not to assure me that, as I was then ﬁf-
 ty-ﬁve years of age, when none could expect to

 memomns. 211
 have good eyesight, and that as I had been
 obliged to use eye-glasses to read or write for
 three years, it was not only rash and foolish
 for me to think that the Lord would help me
 in so marked a manner, but under the circum-
 stances was down-right presumption. But I
 quietly told him that I thought it perfectly
 .consistent, and that it was written, “MOses’
 eye ’vas not dimmed, nor his natural force abat-
 ed,” though he was over a hundred years old,
 and that I “knew in whom I believed,” and was
 not following any cunningly devised fables.”
 I had a son who was unbelieving and for his
 sake I asked the dear Lord to manifest His pow-

 · er on me, that-seeing he might believe that
 God heard and answered prayer. For a. day or
 two I could not see only as I held my reading
 behind a shaded light, at arm's length. ‘ Satan
 meanwhile whispered, What if your God does
 not see ﬁt to strengthen your eyes? What a
 laughing-stock you have made of yourself. You
 ought to use the means God has put into your

 212 mmmm.

 hands. These are your glasses. You ought to
 thank God that you can see with them, and not
 presume to ask so much when you can get
 along as others do, a way that is good enough,
 too. But I cried the more earnestly unto my
 God that He would not let me be put to shame, C
 when I was looking unto Him for salvation.
 Oh, let not my enemies triumph over me; let
 them not say, “Aha, where is now thy God?"
 Satan asked, Now if He don’t heal you, what
 will you do; will you put on your glasses again?
 But the enemy over-reached the mark that
 time and then and there I ended the contro--
 versy by telling him then that if He don’t I‘ll
 stay as I am, for I will trust Him forever. Af-
 ter that Satan left me, and praise be to God
 who giveth us the victory through Jesus. My
 sight began to be better from that time and in
 two Weeks I could see as well as I could with
 the glasses. My eyes continue to grow strong-
 er and I have neuer for one instant used the
 glasses or touched any medicine since that

 throat trouble or other ailment to which I used
 to be subject I take it right to the Healer who
 never once has failed me; and I praise Him that
 I have a hope in a risen living] personal Lord,
 and who answers the “prayer of faith;” and oh
 how I do rejoice that I have no longer to ﬂy
 in aﬁright to drugs, and the help of human arm.
 My son who was looking to see if God could
 save help those who sought Him, was con-
 verted from unbelief and began at once to try
 to serve such a compassionate God, who is “no
 respecter of persons.” When people who knew
 that I had had to use eyeglasses several years,
 have seen me take up a paper or book to read,
 they would say, “Why, don’t you want your
 glasses? I thought you had to use them.” Then
 God has given me strength to tell of His good-
 ness to me so that I could boldly say, “No, I
 trust in One who made my eyes and is abund-
 antly able to repair all damages done by time,
 disease or sin;” and so I give my God the hon-

 Should any read this who are in doubt, who
 fear to walk out on the promises of God by
 faith in Christ, remember that He has prom-
 ised to give us power over all the power _of the
 enemy, if we will bear in mind that we are to
 be strong in His strength. Oh, that this may
 help some soul to believe and trust, and when
 you are healed, ‚' be sure to give God the glory
 and praise, not alone in your heart and closet

 [From “Triumphs of Faith,” December 1887.]

 DEAR MIss JUDD: “Whoso oﬁereth praise
 gloriﬁeth God.” Then even I may glorify
 Him; forI desire to praise Him in telling of
 His goodness to me, that others may be encour-
 aged to simply rest in His word and let His
 blwsed will be done in them. From my ear-

 mxsriuomss. 215
 ‚liest childhood my heart has turned to God,
 and I have been in His Church since my thir-
 teenth year. But only within the last few years,
 since the loss of two of my dear little ones, and
 of my own health, have I felt I must have His
 abiding presence. I thank my Heavenly Father
 that He sent me a kind friend and teacher in
 Mrs. pm Griﬁin, of the Faith Home of'Grand
 Rapids, Michigan. J had suffered for the last
 few years from internal weaknesses and nerv—
 ousness. I did my work for my family, but
 with much weariness, and could not walk a
 short distance without great fatigue and suffer-
 ing much worse afterward. The jar caused by
 one walking across the ﬂoor sometimes seemed
 more than I could hear. I wrote to Mrs. Grif-
 ﬁn of my condition, and that more than all
 else l desired to be wholly the Lord’s; that I was
 willing to do or be anything for Him.
 Shortly after, while walking with a friend, a
 ‘great peace ﬁlled my heart and I felt buoyant,
 and walking was easy, even a pleasure. After

 216 unum.
 returning to the house I wondered at the peace.
 I thought it must be the air, the sunshine, the
 lovely earth that caused it. In a few days I
 received a delayed letter from her, saying that
 they would remember me in prayer on a cer-
 tain day. Then I knew that it was the day I
 was healed and blessed. l had also been_a suf-
 ferer for six years from hay fever. This year
 I suffered more than usual with the fever and
 coughing and great weakness was conﬁned to
 my bed, where I lay tossing and gasping for
 breath. I could think of Peter walking on the
 water, wanting to trust all, yet seeing the waves
 l‘oisterous; and,in weakness, and struggling for
 breath, had only time to say, “Lord save me!"
 One morning I asked my husband if he would
 not write in Miss Judd, asking that I might b_e
 remembered in your faith meeting. He wrote
 immediately and received answer that on Thurs-
 day evening, September 8th you would pray for
 me. On the evening of the 7th I had anothu-
 severe paroxysm, but I kept saying, “If I can

 :rrsrnroxms. - 217

 only, endure until to-morrow night, with the-
 prayers of His Children united with mine, I
 shall be healed.” By this time I could not lie
 down as my breathing was so difﬁcult. ' After
 the family had gone to rest, Inlifted up my
 heart to the Father Who naeth each sparrow,
 that lle would help me to endure the night.
 After a. short time the suﬁering‘ceased; my.
 bream, came naturally, and I rejoicingly said,
 "The Lord has heard me.” How glad my heart
 was, most of all that. _I knew. Hejheard me and
 answered. ·

 On Thursday night I retired to rest and slept
 us I had not for many nights, and- awoke thank-
 ing my Heavenly Father. ⁸I have conswrabed
 r myself and all I have to Him, and I pray as He
 has blessed me I may be a blessing.

 prayer and anointing, I almost hesitated, think-

 work was quickly done after I gave myself into

 after she called oh me and after hearing her

 my surprise l had not gone over a block before
 I felt a strange feeling that is difﬁcult to des-

 forget the feeling. I walked up and did “tell
 what He had done for me,”and came back With-
 out fatigue. From that time I went about my
 business feeling quite well until the last of
 September when I had an attack of dysentery,
 and although the Lord had so wonderfully
 helped me before l thought I must call a
 doctor, and after so doing l seemed to lose the
 faith I formerly had. And my later exper-
 ience is that I cannot pray with so good faith
 while using remedies, knowing that when well,
 I will be likely to give all the credit to “Doctor
 ” or if not the people will think so ,any-
 way, thus robbing Him of the glory. I was.
 very sick, the doctor coming sometimes three
 times a day. But after a time I began to

 gain and by November was able to attend to

 . my business some. About December 1st, I

 sold out and came to this place and gained
 strength slowly until I felt quite comfortable,
 but still obliged to be careful and always a slave
 ,to medicine. In June, I again overdid in some-
 way, still being in the grocery business, and ἆῐιγ
 old difﬁculty came back; I again had recourse
 to the physician in Grand Rapids, in whom I
 had so much conﬁdence, and he treated me for
 several months but I received very little beneﬁt
 from anything, and the last of September had
 another attack of dysentery. I then employed
 another very skilful physician, who cured me
 of the dysentery, but the old difﬁculty remain-
 ed, and although taking three or four kinds of
 medicine, I was conﬁned to the house, and a
 good part of the time to my couch until Feb-
 ruary, sometimes thinking I was a. little better,
 but still not able to stand on my feet any
 length of time.

 In February I went to Muskegon for a visit,

 226 BEULAH.

 my friends thinking the change would do me ,
 good. The trip tired me and I grew worse in—
 stead of better, and my sister-in-law called in
 her physician, who was considered very skilful,
 who after an investigation seemed to agree
 with the others as to what ailed me, but
 thought medical skill could never perform a
 cure so I could ever be able to stand on my feet
 much; said the diﬂiculty was so far inside that
 outward wpplications could do but little, and so
 remote that it was diﬂicult to keep the inﬂam-
 mation down with medicine, thus caused by
 food passing through the strictured intestine,
 and that he did not care to undertake the case.

 But for about two months back something
 within me had kept telling me that I ought to
 seek some Higher Power for my healing, and I
 had studied my Bible some on this point and
 some passages; especially did James 5:14—16
 look very plain to me, and on my way home
 I stopped at Grand Rapids to spend a few days
 with friends there and took the opportunity to

  

 TESTIMONIES. 227

 call for Sister R. T. Parish who is a believer in
 prayer cure and l believed to be a. Christian of
 great faith, and told her that I believed if she
 would pray for me· that it would do me good,
 but she advised me to see Mrs. Dora Grifﬁn at
 the “Beulah” home and with my consent took
 me in her cutter to “Beulah,” where, after my
 giving'my reasons for coming, Sister Grifﬁn
 gave her reasons for believing what was spoken
 by Esaias the prophet, and quoted in Matt. 8:
 17: “Himself took our inﬁrmities and bare our
 sicknesses;” but it was an easy matter, for _I al-
 ready believed. For in reading I had found
 among other things, 1 Cor. 6:19, "What? know
 ye not that your body is the temple of the Ho-
 ly Ghost which is in you, wh ch ye have of
 God, and ye are not your own ΡῚν and I felt that
 Eif l was really a Christian and that if my body
 was a temple in which His Spirit dwelt, that
 He would not wish to See it all run down and
 out of order, any more than people would Wish
 to see their dwellings in disorder. And the

 228 I BEULAH.

 more I studied the stronger I became in the
 belief that the Savior considered the healing
 of the body as being an important work. Mark
 6:5: “And He could there do no mighty work
 save that He laid His hands on a few sick folk
 and healed them.” And from Matt. 15:32:
 “Then called Jesus his disciples unto Him and
 said, I have compassion on the multitnde be-
 cause they continue with me now these three
 days and have nothing to eat, and I will not
 send them away fasting lest they faint by the
 way.” And from the preceding verses 1 learn‘
 ed that the Savior had compassion oﬁ people
 for their bodsly ailments as well as spiritual.
 » And from Heb. 13:8: “Jesus Christ the same.
 yesterday, to-day and forever.” I felt that
 the prayer of faith would save the sick. And
 I asked her for prayer and anointing, according
 to James 5:14, which I received and went my
 way. This was the last day of February, about
 eleven months ago. That day I had been hav-
 ing a_ cold-water pack and Wax tuking three

  

 Tssrrxomss. 229

 kinds of medicine; but from that time laid aside
 all remedies and have not taken a mouthful of
 medicine since, but began to recover. My re⁴
 covery this time was more of a gradual gain
 than before, taking several weeks before I be-
 came really comfortable. Although having
 had so much trouble with my bowels on ac-

 . count of the disease, I cannot remember any

 eleven months when they have been more regu-
 lar than the past. I had been reduced so long
 that my digestion became impaired, which very
 soon became regulated and I could eat anything

 _ I wished without feeling any inconvenience.

 And by the middle of April I felt that I was
 “at the wheel” again, but feeling a little weak;
 but by the ﬁrst of June I felt ﬁrst rate and
 have been well ever since; and now go ahead
 with my work, some days doing a hard day’s
 work for anybody, except that I do not lift
 heavy articles, such as oil or sugar barrels, from
 advice of friends and partly through fear of
 straining myself again. But l feel well and

 and have not worn either bandage or truss (one
 of which I wore for about two years) for about
 ten months.
 › Now to you, Sister Griﬂin, who have been
 the agent in God’s hands of leading me in the
 way of truth, I would say: “Now the God of
 peace that-brought again from the dead our
 Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep,
 through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
 make you perfect in every good work to do llis

 About two years ago I was stricken down
 with paralysis. In eight weeks I had a second
 shock worse than the ﬁrst. For three months
 I was nearly helpless, my right shoulder droop-
 ed an inch or two, and my arm hung perfect-
 ly helpless at my side. There was a constant
 roaring and clashing in my head like the work-
 ing of heavy machinery.

 My. eyelashes were so weak I could only
 partially open my eyes. My whole nervous
 system was so prostratedﬁhat the least move-
 ment or noise caused the greatest distress.
 While in this wretched condition my friend
 Mrs. Cutler, who had been attending the faith
 prayer meetings, brought Mrs. Dora Grifﬁn to
 see me. I decided to give up my medicine and
 physician, and trust my case entirely in the
 hands of the Great Physician, Jesus. I receiv-
 ed the anointing, James 5:14, 15, after which
 Mrs. Grifﬁn said to me: “In the Name of Je—
 sus lift your hand." Immediately I raised my
 hand to my head. All the distress left my

 232 BEULAH.

 head in an instant. My eyes, shoulder and
 side became natural and strong, so that in a
 very short time l was able to do my housework.

 During the month of August, 1887, I suf-
 fered from dysentery which reduced me very
 mueh. Before I had recovered from this I had
 ’ three severe shocks of paralysis, which fol-
 lowed one another in quick succession. When
 Mrs. Grifﬁn cameI was so sore I could not
 bear the Weight of a sheet over my body. Af-
 ter prayer the pain and soreness instantly left
 me. During this sickness I came very ne'ar
 death. l thought my hour had come, and ask-
 ed Mrs.: Grifﬁn to pray for me that I might
 have dying grace. She said she could not of-
 fer that prayer, as she did not feel that my
 work was done. l soon-became cold and‘ rigid
 and sank into a state of unconsciosness, and to
 all human appearance[ was dying. My eyes
 were ﬁxed, and a death pallor and cold perspir-
 ation spread over me, my breath grew less fre-
 quent and shorter, my pulse was nearly gone.

 mmrmomxs. 238

 This continued about ten minutes. Mrs. Grifﬁn
 anointed me and claimed the promises. When
 I became conscious, I had no power to speak
 for nearly an hour. I had scarcely recovered
 from this, when I was seized with a severe at-
 tack of inﬂammatory rheumatism, which re-
 mained about two weeks. I was always re-
 lieved and found rest in answer to prayer and
 fully recovered without any medicine, and I
 give all praise to Jesus, who is my life and de-
 liverer.

 I shall be glad to see anyone who wishes to
 call upon me, or answer correspondence if
 stamp is enclosed.

 I am well and happy in the Lord. ,

 She was in this condition over two years, and
