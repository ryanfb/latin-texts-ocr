 PREFACE

 THIS book will be found to Hitler from the many excel-
 lent editions of the Satires accessible to American students
 chieﬂy in the emphasis which I have desired to place upon
 the thought of Horace, as distinguished from the language
 or the verse or the allusions. That is, without denying
 that Horace may be made useful as the basis for a study
 of Roman life, and without forgetting that it is absurd to
 talk of studying the thought, if the language is only imper-
 fectly understood, I have nevertheless believed that of all
 the Latin writers read in college Horace was the one in
 whose writings literary form could be most interestingly
 studied. In the Satires, too, the connection of thought is
 peculiar and, at ﬁrst, difﬁcult to follow. To meet this difﬁ-
 culty and to -facilitate the understanding of each satire as
 a whole, the introductions have been made somewhat fuller

 than is usual.
 E. P. MORRIS.

 INTRODUCTION

 THE events in the life of Horace are known to us from two
 sources : ﬁrst, from an extract from Suetonius, preserved in the
 manuscripts of Horace and printed below ς and, second, from the
 many personal allusions in his works.

 Quintus Horatius Flaccus was born in Venusia, a Roman
 colony in the borderland between Lucania and-Xpulia, or the
 8th of December, 65 B.C. His father was a freedman, that is,
 he had hm but had bought his freedom or had been
 manumitted, and was engaged in some small business in or
 near Venusia. He was apparently of Italian stock, and in
 character and circumstances he was a man of the older Roman
 type, energetic, prudent, ambitious. The ambition took, in
 particular, the form of a determination to give to his son the
 best possible education and opportunities, —— one of many modern
 touches in the life of Horace, —and in furtherance of this de-
 termination he brought the son to Rome and placed him in one
 of the best schools of the city. Somewhere about MC.
 Horace went to Athens- as young men now go to a university
 -to-c-arry on um and hear lectures on rhetoric, philosophy,
 and mathematics; this was the ordinary culmination of a Roman
 higher education, and Horace at this time, as probably also in
 the school in Rome, formed associations and friendships with
 . young men of intellectual tast⁷es and of social position somewhat
 higher than his own. While he was still a student at Athens,
 not yet quite twenty-one, the death of Caesar in March, 44,
 divided the Roman world into two hostile camps, and when

 7

 INTRODUCTION

 Brutus came to Athens in the late summer of 44, on his way to
 assume the governorship of Macedonia and Asia Minor, Horace
 abandoned his studies and accompanied him with the nominal
 title of tribunus militum. Of the two years that intervened be-
 tween the death of Caesar and the battle of Philippi, in 42, there
 is no record except the rather juvenile seventh satire of the
 First Book. It is probable that his father had died and that the
 property had been lost, perhaps conﬁscated; for when Horace
 returned to Rome in 41, he was obliged to support himself by I
 taking a clerkship/in the tigasury department; here he began
 his career as a writer. ”

 Behind these bare facts of his early life the temperament and
 character of Horace were taking shape. The story has in it
 so much that is modern that we are perhaps in danger of forcing
 the analogies, yet the outlines of the process are clear. Horace
 was a country boy, trained in the prudent traditions of a quiet
 life ; his father desired for him the rise in station which he had
 himself only partially achieved, and sought it by means of a
 higher education and more stimulating associations than a re-
 mote village could afford. From the studies of the university
 the young man was plunged into the ﬂoods of civil war, following
 the leadership of the half-mystical and wholly romantic Brutus.
 He returned to Rome a pardoned rebel; the cause which he
 still believed to have been the cause of liberty was lost; his hopes
 of advancement in public life were at an end; his father was
 dead, his friends scattered, his property gone. Obscure, disap-
 pointed, perhaps a little embittered, he was to begin life over
 again. If this young man seems a different person from the Hor-
 ace whom we associate with graceful love poems and the doctrine
 of the golden mean, it is only because we accept the result
 without following the process which led to it. For the two,
 are identical; there is no break in the development; indeed,
 it is out of precisely such material that the mellow and penetrat-
 ing commentator upon life is made, when success and recogni-

 8

  

 INTRODUCPION

 tion, as well as disenchantment and diﬂiculty, have done their
 part in shaping his character.

 It was in the decade between 41, when he returned after
 Philippi, and 30, when at the age of thirty-ﬁve he published the
 Epodes and the Second Book of Satires, that his character and
 his life philosophy were matured. Few events are known to us
 out of these years. In 39 or 38 he was introduced by Vergil
 and Varius to Maecenas, and in 33 he received from Maecenas
 the gift of the Sabine farm, which was in a special sense his
 home for the re’st of his life. But the intimacy with the circle
 of poets and critics who were gathered about Maecenas, greatly

 Δ as it stimulated him, and the lasting friendship with Maecenas

 himself, with all the resulting beneﬁts, were only important in-
 cidents in his development; his real life was in his writings.
 He began with a group of three satires, 2, 7, and 8 of Book I,
 and it was these which, with some of the Epodes, brought him
 to the notice of Vergil, and ultimately of Maecenas. They are
 plainly the work of a young writer. The seventh, though it is
 well written, is trivial; the eighth is a kind of burlesque Priapus-
 poem, without wit or real humor, unpleasantly personal and with
 no marked attractiveness of style. Of the second it must be
 said plainly that it is an attempt to draw attention by jesting
 indecency; there is no other possible interpretation of the choice
 of subject. On the other hand, the style of the seventh is good,
 the eighth is better than most poems of its kind, and the second,
 except in the choice of subject, is the real Horace, easy in style
 and handling, humorous and yet in acertain way serious. There
 is enough of sharpness and even of bitterness in it to explain the
 criticisms that it brought upon the writer, and the tone of the
 next satire, 4 of Book I, shows that Horace was himself aware
 that the earlier satires needed defense, if not apology. But a
 clear-sighted critic, on the lookout, as the members of the circle
 of Maecenas were, for young men of promise, would certainly
 have seen that the writer of these poems was a man not to be

 9

 INTRODUCP ION

 neglected. The satires which followed the admission of Horace
 to the friendship of Vergil and Varius and Maecenas need no
 speciﬁc comment beyond that which will be found in the special
 introductions; they are not the work of an obscure beginner,
 but of a man tempered by association with men of taste, mel-
 lowed by friendly recognition, and already master of an easy
 style and a sane and humorous philosophy of life.

 His choice of satire as a means of expression is explained by
 Horace in Sat. 1, 10, 40-47 ; he says that other ﬁelds —- comedy,
 tragedy, the epic, the bucolic —were already occupied, and that
 satire alone seemed open to him. But this explanation is not to

 be taken seriously; the causes which determined his choice were ,

 deeper, partly in his own temperament, partly in the conditions
 of his time. He was by nature an observer of men; he found in
 the interplay of character and circumstance a spectacle of con-
 stant interest, and the account which he gives (Sat. 1, 4, 105-143)
 of the teachings of his father and of his own habitual attitude,
 however humorous the application which he makes of it, is
 essentially true. To a man of such a habit of mind satire, in
 the sense which Horace gave to the word, as a good-natured
 commentary, that is, upon the follies and upon the virtues, too,
 of the men with whom he lived, was the most natural vehicle of
 expression. In so far as he was inclined toward more serious
 and emotional expression, he used at ﬁrst the half-lyrical form
 of the Epodes, and the absence of the more profound feelings
 from the Satires is to be explained in part by the fact that they
 found another outlet in such poems as Epodes 4, 7, 9, and 16.
 But these strongly emotional verses look backward to the tem-
 pestuous past; they express the attitude of the obscure and
 defeated republican, struggling with circumstances and not yet
 in harmony with himself, and their subjects belong rather to
 the period of strife than to the new era upon which Rome was
 entering. The Augustan Age, precisely because it checked the
 vigorous public activities of the preceding period and turned
 10

 INTRODUCTION

 men back upon science and philosophy and law and literature,
 was of all periods in Roman history the one which offered the
 most inviting material for humorous commentary. As on the
 crowded streets of the city men of every country and of all
 stations met and passed on, — a peasant from the mountains, a
 deposed Eastern king, a Greek philosopher, a Roman noble, —
 so in the complex social structure motives of every possible
 form and color were at work. Though public activities were
 checked, the ofﬁce-holding and ofﬁce-seeking politician ﬂourished
 as he always ﬂourishes under a one-man power, and his ambi-
 tions, selﬁsh enough, yet not wholly unworthy, were an open
 invitation to discriminating satire. The immense business
 interests, too, which centered at Rome, presented then, as now,
 their puzzling mixture of motives andof inﬂuences, and it was to
 the man of business that Horace addressed the satire which was
 the preface to his ﬁrst collected publication, as if the business
 man was to him the most marked ﬁgure of the age. Inter-
 mingled with these ambitions as a kind of common reward for
 every form of success was the prize of social recognition and
 prominence, which seems to have had for a Roman, with his
 outspoken personal conceits and vanities, an attractiveness even
 greater and more general than it has in modern societies; and
 certainly no spectacle offers itself more invitingly to the genial
 satirist than the spectacle of the social struggle. Horace played
 his part in society, as Thackeray did, and gathered material for
 his Book of Snobs. Somewhat apart from all these rivalries,
 ,but with rivalries no less keen in their own sphere, were the two
 schools of philosophy, the Epicurean and the Stoic. Horace is
 often, in a vague way, regarded as an Epicurean, but he was, in
 fact, of no school or of a school of his own, and it is not as an _
 Epicurean that he occasionally strikes a sudden blow at a Stoic,
 or, more often, burlesques the paradoxes of the school with
 ironical solemnity. He recognized the underlying truth of the
 Stoics; he was by no means unconscious of the seriousness of

 II

 INTRODUCTION

 life; he was, indeed, himself a preacher; but he was also a
 discriminating humorist, and the formal Stoic, apparently more
 concerned about the growth of his beard than about his growth
 in grace, and more insistent upon the phraseology of his doctrines
 than upon their intelligibility, appealed to both sides of his
 mind. In the long picture gallery of the Satires no ﬁgure is
 more frequently recurrent. Nor did Horace neglect the men of
 his own craft. The Augustan Age, which is often called the
 golden age of Latin literature, was, at any rate, a period most
 proliﬁc in skillful writers. Through chance allusions, serious or
 satirical, we are able to see, behind the ﬁgures of the greater
 poets whose writings have survived to our times, a long array of
 men of lesser rank, not undistinguished among their contempo-
 raries, and undoubtedly writers of merit. And below them was
 I the crowd of poets and historians and critics and essayists whose
 names even have been lost. Here was rich material for the satirist,
 ' and material especially for such a satirist as Horace, who was
 always as much critic as poet and interested alike in the practice
 and in the theory of his art. Somewhat less prominent in the
 life of the city, yet marked enough to give occasional color to
 the scene, were various minor caprices or eccentricities, each
 with its little circle of devotees. There were the collectors of
 old bronzes and tableware, indifferent to the artistic imperfec-
 tions of their rare pieces, but credulous of their antiquity. The
 professional musicians formed, then as now, a class by them-
 selves, with their own standards and judgments. Petty oﬁicials
 rejoiced in opportunities to display themselves in elaborate
 costume. It is in part the notice which Horace has bestowed
 upon them that makes the so—called legacy hunters seem to have
 been so numerous in Rome, but the brilliant satire in which
 their arts are burlesqued was the product of observation, not of
 invention. The proper arrangement of a menu and the doctrines
 of gastronomy were quite certainly matters of serious concern to
 many persons in Roman society, though it is possible that the
 12

  

 INTRODUCTION

 humorously detailed descriptions and travesties in the Second
 Book make the followers of this particular mania more promi-
 nent than they actually were in Roman life. But certainly the
 society to which Horace’s friendship with Maecenas gave him
 access was a highly complex society, one which brought before
 his observant eye a most interesting variety of types and of in-
 dividuals, and invited good-humored comment and even caustic
 remark. The Satires are not the result of so mechanical a
 choice as Horace jokingly implies, but the inevitable expression
 of the reﬂections of such a man as Horace was upon such a
 society as that of the *Augustan Age.

 The form which Horace’s commentary on life was to take
 was already determined for him. In this respect ancient
 literature was to a high degree conventional and traditional;
 when once the type was ﬁxed by the inﬂuence of some great
 originator, the range of subsequent deviation from the type was
 small. Didactic poetry was written in hexameters from Hesiod
 to Ovid; innovator as Euripides was, his variations from the
 norm of tragedy are in reality slight. Form and content are
 identiﬁed under one name in the iambi of Archilochus. The
 form of Roman satire, or at least the prevalent form, was ﬁxed
 by C. Lucilius. He was an eques of the period of the Gracchi
 and the younger Scipio Africanus, a man of education and rank,
 a conservative in politics, and a writer of force and courage.
 His range of subjects was not very different from that of Horace,
 -literary criticism, ethical discussion, social comment,—but
 a large place was occupied by political satire, which was almost
 inevitable in that stormy period and in the writings of a friend
 ‘of Scipio. In tone he was, so far as can be judged from the
 extant fragments and from the statements of his successors,
 extremely personal and harsh. The fact that the fragments of
 his writings have come down largely in quotations by the gram-
 marians, who were interested chieﬂy in unusual words or
 phrases, makes it difﬁcult to form an independent judgment

 33

 INTRODUCTION

 of his style. The longest quotation, a deﬁnition of virtus in⁸
 thirteen verses, is not without dignity of thought and expres-
 sion, but in general the criticism of Horace, that Lucilius
 wrote too freely and with too little attention to ﬁnish of style,
 seems to be justiﬁed. The loss of his writings is a loss to lin-
 guistic and literary history, rather than to literature itself. But
 he performed the great service of determining both the tone and
 the form of satire. ⁷He gave to it for all time that critical and
 censorious tone which is still associated with the name and,
 after considerable experiment with other verse forms which had
 been used by Ennius, he settled upon the hexameter as the
 most suitable meter. In selecting satire as his ﬁeld, Horace
 therefore felt himself bound by all the force of strong tradition
 to a certain tone and a certain verse.

 But the force of tradition and convention in ancient literature,
 strong as it was, did not preclude originality; it merely set the
 bounds within which originality might work. Of imitation, in
 any proper sense of the word, that is, of attempt to copy as
 closely as possible the work of an older writer, there is very
 little evidence in Greek or Latin literature, and Horace, setting
 himself to write Lucili ritu, as he says, accepting as his starting
 point the deﬁnition which Lucilius had given to satire, was
 also acutely conscious of the imperfections of his predecessor,
 and fully determined to avoid them in his own work. The
 most evident of these imperfections was in the matter of style.
 The fragments of the satires of Lucilius are bold and crude in
 expression ; they say what was to be said, but they say it with-
 out charm. There is no evidence of care for workmanship,
 of pleasure in attractive expression. But between Lucilius*
 and Horace was the great Ciceronian period, in which the whole
 subject of Latin style in prose and in verse was most warmly
 debated by men who were daily practicing the art of writing.
 Two generations had contributed to raise the standard of good
 style, and Horace and the friends with whom he lived were

 14

 INTRODUCTION

 desirous of raising it still further. Horace was, besides, by
 nature a literary artist, to whom the shaping of phrases into
 eﬁective and pleasing form was an end in itself. It is, indeed,
 surprising to a modern reader that the justice of his guarded
 and moderate criticisms of the style of Lucilius should have
 been questioned by any intelligent student of Latin literature
 in the Augustan Age. That he was entirely successful in his
 attempt to improve in respect to style upon the work of his
 predecessor has never been doubted.

 The other direction in which Horace endeavored to sur-
 pass Lucilius, without deviating too widely from the type, led
 him into greater difﬁculties. The satire of Lucilius was un-
 doubtedly pungent and bitter in its attacks upon persons and
 upon parties, and this savageness of tone, which in various
 forms was familiar and agreeable to the Romans, was, in fact,
 an essential element in satire of the Lucilian type. But it
 was in every way impossible in the Augustan Age; the polit-
 ical situation between 42 and 31 B.C. would not have borne
 rough handling, and the softening of manners had put a check
 upon personalities. The problem, therefore, which presented
 itself to Horace was to retain the pungency of individual
 criticism without violation of the canons of good taste and with-
 out oﬂense to public men. A part of the problem he made no
 attempt to solve; he left politics out of his satire entirely,
 even at the time when his patriotic feeling was expressing
 itself in the Epode quo, quo scelesti mitid and in Epode 16. -
 But to the problem of giving to his satire the appearance
 without the reality of personal attack, he addressed himself
 with much ingenuity. The Satires seem to bristle with proper
 names, but examination shows that only a very few of the
 allusions ’are in fact personal attacks. Many of the names
 are taken from Lucilius and had long since ceased to be
 anything but types in literature. Others are from the Cice-
 ronian period, the names of men who were then notorious.

 I5

 INTRODUCTION

 Still others, men of Horace’s day, were in their lifetime al-
 ready so much the subject of open gossip and comment that
 an allusion to them was no more properly offensive or, indeed,
 personal, than an allusion in a modern newspaper to the men
 whose names are upon everybody’s lips. Many names are
 ﬁctitious, some pure inventions like the names in a novel,
 others disguising an allusion to a real person. The residuum
 of actual personality, such as would be oﬁensive to modern
 feeling, is extremely small. Direct attack upon an individual
 was, in fact, as little to Horace’s taste as to our own, and
 was incompatible with the lightness of touch which he was
 endeavoring to attain. Even the semblance of severity, which
 the Lucilian tradition obliged him to maintain in his earlier
 work, grows less distinct as he becomes conscious of his pe-
 culiar powers. The Second Book has less of it than the First;
 indeed, the ﬁrst satire of that book is a kind of travesty of
 the severely personal satire and, by implication, a renuncia-
 tion of it. The place of Horace in the history of Roman
 satire is, it is true, in the line of succession from Lucilius,
 but his own contribution to that history amounts almost to
 the creation of a new literary genre, a new variety of satire.
 The events in the life of Horace after the publication of the
 Epodes and the Second Book in 30 B.C. are of interest to the
 reader of the Satires only in so far as they interpret his earlier
 period. He turned at once from satire to lyric poetry, following
 still further the path upon which he had entered in the Epodes,
 and published in 23 B.C. the ﬁrst three books of the Odes, to
 which he gave the best of his powers and the best years of his
 life. Aside from other and more determining motives,—the
 inner impulse and the fact that the lyric is a higher form of art
 than satire,——the choice doubtless indicates also a. feeling that
 he had for the time exhausted the ﬁeld of satire, that he had
 carried his modiﬁcations of the Lucilian type as far as it was
 possible for him to carry them. But the habit of observation

 16

 INTRODUCTION

 was still strong in him, and after the publication of the Odes
 he resumed his commentary on life and society in the form
 of epistles in hexameter. By the choice of a new and different
 form he freed himself from the limitations of satire; at the
 same time, as the tradition of the epistle in verse was less
 deﬁnitely ﬁxed, the new form did not hamper him. The in-
 terval that separates such a satire as 2, 6 from such an epistle
 as I, 7 is very slight; by addressing the satire to Maecenas, he
 could easily have made it an epistle in form, and with a few
 modiﬁcations the epistle might have been published with the
 Satires. It might be said that the three collections of hexame-
 ter poetry represent three steps in a continuous process; the
 First Book of the Satires is, in the main, satire after the man-
 ner of Lucilius, the Second Book is an experiment with the
 dialogue form, and the First Book of the Epistles marks the
 complete breaking away from the Lucilian tradition. They are
 three stages in the working out of a literary form within which
 the temperament of Horace could express itself with the least
 possible sense of restriction.

 Before his death, which occurred on the 2Lth__of November,
 8 3.2., Horace was already recognized as the greatest of Ro-
 mail lyric poets and as the most conspicuous ﬁgure, next to
 Vergil, in the literature of his time. This position his poems
 retained after his death; they were universally read and were
 used as text-books in schools. Critical and learned commen-
 tary began to gather about them in the ﬁrst century of the Em-
 pire, and, before the fall of Roman power in the West, copies
 of his works were in wide circulation, often prefaced by the
 account of his life from Suetonius and annotated with scholia.
 During the Middle Ages, when knowledge of the ancient world
 was at its lowest, his poems were still read in schools and fre-
 quently copied in the monastery libraries, and with the Revival
 of Learning many editions were issued from the early printing
 presses. In modern times they have formed a part of the

 HOR. SAT. — 2 I 7

 INTRODUCTION

 school or university curriculum in all countries ; they have been
 translated more often than the works of any other ancient
 writer, and have deeply inﬂuenced modern literature. All this
 is evidence of the high esteem in which his poetry has been
 held by scholars and men of letters; the estimate of men of
 affairs, of men outside of academic life, is somewhat similar.
 For it is probably true that of all the writers of Greek and Latin
 poetry—many of them greater than Horace—no one has so
 frequently been carried away from the university life and be-
 come a part of the familiar intellectual furniture of educated
 men in active life. The explanation of an interest so wide-
 spread and so long-continued is not, of course, to be sought in
 those qualities or characteristics which Horace shares with
 other writers. He reﬂects, it is true, a highly interesting period
 in history, but the letters of Cicero are an even more vivid re-
 ﬂection of a more critical period. His poetic form, as it is
 worked out in the lyrics, is most admirable, and poetic form is
 one of the main reasons for our continued study of the two
 classic literatures, but the range of its attractive power is
 limited. That which has differentiated Horace from other
 writers and made him permanently attractive to men of widely
 varied taste is independent of his circumstances and, to a con-
 siderable degree, of his artistic form; it lies partly in the
 personal character which his writings disclose and partly in the
 permanent worth of his comments upon life.

 The character of a ,writer or an artist as it shows itself in his
 work must be learned by indirection, by impressions repeated
 and deepened into familiarity. For this kind of personal ac-
 quaintance Horace gives abundant material. Enough has been
 said above to correct the notion that he was a dilettantc, playing
 with life. He was, it is true, fundamentally an observer rather
 than an actor, and he was by temperament genial and tolerant;
 these are the qualities upon which the charm of his personality
 rests; but a merely temperamental tolerance is, like tempera-

 18

 INTRODUCTION

 mental optimism, a very superficial and uninteresting quality.
 Horace was a man of warm feeling and of strong convictions,
 though his convictions are in part alien to our thought, and the
 lightness with which he sometimes touches serious things is not
 the lightness of carelessness. He had learned early, not with-
 out struggle and pain, the lesson of adjustment to the limita-
 tions of life, had learned that the secret of a composed and
 digniﬁed life lies in the acceptance of the inevitable. Even in
 his lessvcheerful moods he faced his heaviest losses with steadi-

 ness o durum = sed levius ﬁt patientia,
 quidquid corrigere est nefas.

 But his ordinary mood was not tragic; he preferred to meet
 life with a smile, not underestimating the possibilities of loss
 and trouble, but also not overestimating them: And it is the
 fact that his genial acceptance of life rests upon a foundation of
 cool judgment and shrewd comprehension that gives it mean-
 ing. It is this combination that makes him the philosopher for
 men of the world. For the man of affairs, if he is conscious of
 life at all, is seeking for a formula which will include all the
 follies and weaknesses of men and will teach him how to accept
 them with a smile. The real meaning of Horace’s philosophy
 is poorly expressed by nil admirari, as the words are commonly
 understood, and not very well by aurea medtbcritas,· it is a phi-
 losophy of comprehension and tolerance, and the charm of his
 personality is that he so perfectly embodies his own doctrine.
 The value of his comments upon men and society lies partly
 in the application of his philosophy to life, partly in the peculiar
 forms in which he expresses it. His satires, and, to a less
 degree,his epistles, are a picture gallery. He does not describe
 individuals or, if he does, it is in terms so general as to make
 them types; his little pictures are done in few lines, but in lines
 so expressive that they tell the essential truth about a man.
 Such a characterization as that of Tigellius in Sat. 1, 3 or that

 39

 INTRODUCTION

 of Damasippus in Sat. 2, 3, or the longer description by sugges-
 tion in Sat. I, 9, is as true and as recognizable now as it was
 when it was written, because it presents the essential qualities
 which are of no single period or race. The power to draw
 such pictures is not, it is true, the highest kind of artistic power,
 and it does not necessarily carry with it either a profound phi-
 losophy or great breadth of view. Great artists have lacked it,
 and some caricaturists have had it. The most obvious modern
 illustrations are in ﬁction; George Eliot had not a trace of it;
 Anthony Trollope had it in a high degree. Such little pictures
 do not teach us the meaning of life, in its larger aspects and
 relations. They teach us in a nearer way about people; they

 · show us how to analyze and classify; they stimulate our in-

 telligent comprehension of the men we meet. The reader of
 Horace, if he gets his lesson truly, understands better the man
 who sits in the seat next to him, and, if he becomes a true
 disciple, he understands himself better, too.

 SERMONES

 LIBER PRIMVS

 I

 There is no reference to current events sufﬁciently deﬁnite to ﬁx the
 date of this Satire by internal evidence. It was written aﬂer Horace’s
 introduction to Maecenas in 38, and the maturity of style and treatment
 show a great advance upon the early Satires of this book, 2, 7, and 8.
 Obviously, it is introductory to the whole book, published in 35, and it
 was probably written shortly before that date.

 ‘ What is the source of the social discontent of our times? Not, cer-
 tainly, as is sometimes said, in the peculiar hardships of this or that '
 occupation. «The very men who offer this explanation disprove it by
 their conduct. Nor can the persistent devotion of men to business be
 justiﬁed, as some of them appear to think, by the praiseworthy desire
 to provide against future needs. It is something deeper than this and
 less worthy -the mere desire to get rich, to be richer than others.

 ‘ A life given up to this pursuit is no better than the life of the miser
 of ﬁction. Such a man dares not spend anything, lest he spend all,
 and does not see that, to one who lives a natural life, the possession
 of what is never to be used is not a gain, but a burden.

 ‘ To say that social standing depends upon money is to say what is
 perhaps true, but is not to the point. For the result is the same;
 the man with such an ambition merely gathers wealth to tantalize him-
 self, purchasing only terrors and unhappiness with it. He kills the
 natural affections, and spends his life in providing against contingen.
 cies that will, in all probability, never arise. I am not arguing that one
 should waste his money ; that is only another extreme of folly; between
 the two lies the safe middle course.

 ‘ The source of our unhappiness, to answer the question with which
 I began, is the desire to be rich, to be a little richer. We forget the
 many who are poorer than we, and see only the few who are ahead of

 23

 us. We spend our lives in an ignoble struggle, and we come still
 unsatisﬁed to the end.

 ‘Enough of sermonizing. I’m no Crispinus.’

 The subject of this introductory satire is the race for wealth. In the
 universal peace which followed the civil wars, the ﬁnancial affairs of the
 world centered at Rome as an imperial clearing house, and great for-
 tunes were rapidly made by men of the capitalist class. In general, the
 old nobility and the philosophers and writers kept aloof from business,
 which consequently fell into the hands of the equites, who had had only
 a slight part in public affairs, or of the freedmen, who were ill-ﬁtted by
 character and experience to make a large-minded or even a rational use
 of their money. Some of them burst out into ridiculous display, and
 furnished easy material for the satirist; others, with less obvious folly,
 knew no better use of their acquired wealth than to make it the means
 of acquiring still more. lt is to men of the latter class that this dis-
 course is addressed. For this is not pure satire, holding up the pecul-
 iarities of certain men to the scorn of others; it is, in part, a discourse,
 a sermon, addressed directly to the over-eager man of business, and
 intended to show to him, for his possible betterment, the intrinsic little-
 ness of the occupation to which he was so ardently devoting himself.

 Horace frequently employs in other places the thoughts and some-
 times the ﬁgures and expressions of this satire. Compare especially
 the end of Epode 1, the main thought of Epode 2, and the whole of
 Epode 4. The similarity between the social structure of the Augustan ,
 Age and our own times could scarcely be made more vivid than it is by
 the fact that the satirist of that society chose for the theme of his open-
 ing satire the race for wealth. J

 mere chance. The same contrast
 is implied in Sat. 1, 6, 54, though
 ratio is not actually used. The
 two verbs, dederit, obiecerit, carry
 on the contrast between the de-
 liberate and the accidental.

 3. landet: the full expression
 of the thought would seem to re-
 quire sed unus quisque laudet, but
 the negative of nemo goes only
 with contentus, not with vivat, so

 ⁴that the thought is ‘every one is

 discontented with his own life and
 envious of the lives of others.’
 Cf. vs. 109, where the phrases
 nemo se probet ( = contentus vivat)
 and laudet are connected by ac
 potius. The meaning of laudare
 is not precisely to praeire, but ‘to
 speak of with admiration,‘ as in
 Plaut. Rud. 523, laudo fortunas
 tuas, and in combination with
 deversa sequentis it suggests the
 idea of envy.

 4-12. The two pairs of con-
 trasted examples — soldier and
 sailor, lawyer and farmer—and
 indeed the whole scene which is
 half described, half suggested in
 vss. 15—22, come from the con-
 ventional popular philosophy, per-
 haps from some Greek burlesque
 drama. Horace uses them fre-
 quently with slight variations.

 25

 4-5. The first illustration is
 barely suggested, without speciﬁc
 details. gravis· annis means, in
 ordinary usage, weighed down with
 years, not distinguishing between _
 years of life and years of service,
 and the thought is repeated and
 ampliﬁed in the next phrase.—
 fractus membru broken in health.
 The soldier, feeling old and worn,
 says, ‘I wish I had gone into
 business.’

 6-8. memtor: a merchant who
 sails his own vessel on a business
 venture, as the merchants in the
 China trade did a hundred years
 ago. He is therefore called, in-
 differently, either mercator or
 nauta (vs. 29), and the following
 lines deal only with the hardships
 of the sailor’s life. —iactantibus: ,
 the tense is important; he is
 in the midst of a gale—Austria:
 the southerly winds are heavy and
 squally in the Mediterranean, and
 Home generally uses Auster with
 an implication of storm, as ‘ north-
 easter’ is used in English. -Quid

 enim was originally a strengthen-
 ing particle, and before it had
 acquired the meaning for, it formed
 compound phrases with conjunc-

 There is no ellipsis here-Con-

 the brevity of the crisis in a
 soldier’s life. — horae momento:
 the Romans did not measure
 short spaces of time with pre-
 cision, and there is no Latin word
 for ‘minute’ or ‘second.’ hora
 is therefore somewhat vague, like
 the English ‘the hour of victory ’;
 cf. puncto mobilis horae, Epist.
 2, 2, 172.--The second illustra-
 tion is more detailed than the
 ﬁrst. and the folly of the momen-
 tary desire to exchange occupa-
 tions is more clearly suggested.
 The sailor‘s endurance is broken
 down by the long-continued storm,
 and he wishes for the short crisis
 “ of the soldier’s life, forgetting
 alike the greater proﬁts of a busi-
 ness career and the wearisome
 routine of garrison life.

 9-10. Agricolamlaudatxsearcely
 more than ‘ wishes he were a farm-
 er.’— ius and leges are sometimes
 contrasted,—z.g., as the general
 body of law and the special legis-
 lative enactments,—-but here the
 two contrasting terms are used
 together to express one general
 idea. —peritus: the patronus, to

 26

 whom friends and clients came at
 the early morning salutatio to ask
 advice on business and legal mat-
 ters. There is a personal touch
 in this illustration, for Horace did
 not like to get up early (ad quar-
 tam iaceo, Sat. ι, 6, 122).

 31-12. Ille: the other, the farm-
 er, of the class whose unembar-
 rassed life the lawyer has just been
 praising. He is not quite identi-
 ﬁed with the consultam-datis
 vadibus: not necessarily bail in
 a criminal action, but surety for
 his appearance as defendant in any
 legal case. In this second pair
 of illustrations Horace allows the
 absurdity of the discontent to ap-
 pear plainly and comically. The
 lawyer, in his momentary annoy-
 ance at being called early in the
 morning, wishes he were a farmer,
 forgetting that the farmer is habit-
 ually an early riser. The lack of
 serious consideration on the part
 of the countryman is shown by
 the suddenness of his conversion ;
 he has been dragged (extractus)
 against his will into the city, but
 once there he loudly proclaims
 (clamat) not only that the city is
 better than the country, but even
 that city people are the only per-
 sons who are happy.

 touches as this, given in passing
 and merely by way of illustration.
 Cf. the allusion to Crispinus be-
 low, vs. 120. And these humor-
 ous attentions are often bestowed
 upon the Stoics, whose formalism
 and austerity were repugnant to a
 man of Horace⁷s temperament,and
 led him to overlook their good
 qualities. With all their superﬁ-

 whole passage, 15-22, reads like
 a description of a mimus, in which
 a god suddenly appears upon the

 good nature, grants their wishes;
 then, as it appears at once from
 their looks that they do not really
 desire the change, his good nature
 changes to comic anger. From
 vss. 4 f., which are serious in ex-
 pression and thought, to the ﬁnal
 burlesque there is a gradual and
 skillful uncovering of the under-

 this point the thought turns more
 directly toward the main subject
 of the satire—money-making—
 and, in the review of the four types
 of discontented men from this
 point of view, the iuris consultus,
 who serves for honor rather than
 fees, is omitted, and the caupo,
 huckster, innkeeper,› is substi-
 tuted; as a man of the town, he
 makes a good contrast to the
 farmer. For variety, the order
 also is changed-pertidum peo-
 ple of the better classes seldom
 used inns in traveling (compare
 Sat. I, 5), and the poor taverns
 frequented by slaves and laborers
 had a bad reputation for cheating
 and robbery.

 30. currunt: this verb is used
 of sailing also in Epist. 1, I, 45;
 I, 11, 27 and perhaps in Carm.
 1, 28, 36. Cf. ‘run before the

 explained in the clause ut . . .
 recedant.

 31-35. These lines contain the
 explanation which men give of
 their, apparent inconsistency in
 continuing in occupations which
 they themselves complain of as

 dangerous or wearisome, and the
 words. are carefully selected:
 senes, ‘only when they are old’;
 otia tuta, ‘ freedom from labor and
 danger’; recedant, ‘retire’; con-
 gesta, ⁴ scraped together’; cibaria,
 rations, ‘just enough to live on.’
 It is a reminder of the modern-
 ness of the Augustan Age that
 all these expressions find easy
 counterparts in the talk of men
 who are mrrying the loads of life
 in our time.

 the omission is not infrequent.
 The ant is occasionally referred to
 elsewhere in Latin literature as a
 model of industry (eg. Verg.
 Georg. ι, ῐ86), but the frequency
 of the comparison in modern lit-
 erature is doubtless due to How-
 erbs 6, 6.

 subject of the satire is reached,
 the foolish complaints and false
 pleas of discontented men having
 been pushed aside. At this point,
 too, the dialogue form and the
 direct address (te, tibi, te) become
 more distinct. Vss. 28—35, which
 contain the plea in defence, begin
 descriptively, then fall into infor-
 mal indirect quotation, and close
 (sicut parvola) with what is in
 effect a direct quotation. And
 the reply, 36—40, in which the plea
 is shown to be false, continues
 and accentuates the directness of
 dialogue, and thus emphasizes the
 point toward which the discussion
 has been tending. The whole in-
 troduction, 1-40, is a good ex-
 ample of the manner of Horace.

 a heaping—up of epithets (immen-

 The man of business in the
 Augustan Age had his investments
 and his varied money interests
 and no more buried his coin in a
 hole in the ground than the cau-
 tious investor of our time keeps
 his money in an old stocking.
 The verses really constitute an ar-

 comparison: ‘What is the good
 of it all to you? You‘re no better
 than a regular miser.‘

 43. Quod: usually taken to be
 the prom, = at id, as quae, 36, is
 taken. But it is, I think, the
 ordinary adversative quod si, which
 is freely used by Horace; cf. Epist.

 -amples in Kühner, II, 872. In this
 usage quod conj. has diverged only
 slightly from quod pron., and when
 a possible antecedent can be found
 before it (here pondus), it may
 easily be mistaken for the pron.
 But the thought is really general:
 ‘ but if you once begin the
 breaking-up process, your money
 is soon gone.’ These words are
 not the reply of a real miser, but a
 perfectly sound maxim of prudence
 —‘ if you once begin to dip into your
 capital, it will soon be gone’; but
 it is misused by the man of acquis-

 reply is not very effective and it
 is, in fact, scarcely more than an

 52 ff. continues the thought of
 intra naturaejinis viventi, with a
 side reference to ex magno acervo.

 drawing off a liquid, used here

 takes the inﬁn. haurire.
 ’ 53. cumeris granatim camerae
 are described by the scholiast as
 small bins of wickerwork or large
 earthenware jars, used for storing
 small quantities of grain. The
 word is somewhat rare, but is
 used again by Horace (Epist. 1, 7,
 30) and was perhaps familiar to
 him from the management of his
 own small farm. It is, of course,
 set in contrast to the granaria of
 the large estate, and the sentence
 really repeats the idea of 45—46
 and of 49-51 .

 a note of false pathos,—‘My

 without an interrogative particle
 in half—exclamatory sentences.—
 pugnantia secum, frontibus adver-

 pressions combine to suggest from
 different sides the ﬁgure of two
 gladiators, matched (componere
 is the technical word) against one
 another. So the argument of vss.
 101 f. sets up the ﬁgure of the
 vappa ac nebuh to destroy the
 effect of the ﬁgure of the avarus,
 as described in the body of the
 satire.

 305. The reference is probably
 to some Greek saying, then well
 enough known to make a mere
 allusion intelligible; at any rate,
 the names represent two widely
 separated extremes.

 307. ultra citraque: the safe
 ‘ middle ground ’ is the only place
 where the right (ὀρθόν) can ﬁnd
 a sure standing place.

 108 f. Illuc, unde abii, rodeo:
 this is ’not perfectly accurate. To
 return precisely to the opening
 question, ‘What is the source
 of our discontent ?’ would be ab-
 surd, since the whole satire has

 been spent in setting forth the
 answer to that question. But a
 repetition of the text is a very suit-
 able way of bringing the sermon
 to its conclusion. Horace there—
 fore repeats the opening words
 (qui nemo se probet = qui fit ut
 nemo contentus mil/at), attaching
 them somewhat forcedly to the
 leading clause illuc redeo and in-
 serting the substance of the answer
 in the brief phrase ut avarus, which
 is taken up more fully in vss. no E.
 The obscurity produted by using
 qui nemo instead of qui ﬁt ut nemo
 and by making it depend upon
 illuc redeo is increased by the use
 of ut avarus (= ‘because of the
 love of money ’; cf. ut male sanos,
 Epist. 1, 19, 3; ut capitis minor,
 Oder 3, 5, 42), which is easily mis-
 taken for a repetition of the ut in
 qui ﬁt ut. The obscurity of the
 passage has led copyists into mak-
 ing various changes in the text,
 nemo ut, nemon ut. The true
 reading was found only in a single
 manuscript. ‘I come back to my
 starting point, the discontent of
 men, which comes from their love
 of money and their envy.’

 This satire was written before 3, since the death of Tigellius, which
 is there (vs. 3 if.) referred to as having occurred some time before, is
 here spoken of as a quite recent event, and before 4, where (in vs. 91)
 a line of this satire (vs. 27) is quoted. It is therefOre to be placed in
 the group of early satires, with 7 and 8, written before the introduction
 to Maecenas in 39 or 38 B.C.

 The announced subject of the satire is the tendency of men to run to
 extremes, their inability to keep to the golden mean. Of this tendency
 the ﬁrst part, down to vs. 28, gives various illustrations, not lacking in
 humor and unobjectionable in tone. But the particular illustration
 which is treated in detail, and which occupies the rest of the satire, is
 excess in sensual indulgence, and especially the vice of adultery, which
 had become rife in the Ciceronian period and was still increasing in
 Roman society.

 The satire betrays in various ways the immaturity of the writer. It
 is the most personal of Horace’s writings; it is coarse in expression,
 and it is intentionally sensational in manner. These characteristics are
 in part the result of a too close adherence to the manner of Lucilius, in
 part of a desire to attract attention, in part of the bitter and rebellious
 feeling of the writer. Yet it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd in it, as undoubtedly
 Vergil and Varius did, the indications of what the writer was later to
 become.

 The only indication of the date of this satire is the allusion in vs.
 64, which implies a considerable degree of intimacy with Maecenas, to
 whom Horace was introduced in the year 38. In style and thought-it
 is one of the more mature satires of the First Book.

 ‘ Musical people are odd. Look at Tigellius, a bundle of inconsistent
 absurdities. “Very ﬁne,” says some one, “but how about you, who
 criticize others with so much penetration? Are you faultless your-
 self?” “Not at all,” answers the critic, “but, frankly,l don’t think

 my faults are as bad as his." No, you do not, and your self-satisﬁed
 attitude is a proper subject for a satire.

 ‘ Your habit of criticism brings its natural result, that others criticize
 you, and both you and they, seizing upon some triﬂing fault, fail to see
 the ﬁner and nobler qualities and, still worse, make no effort to correct
 ymtll Uighleligtshve might rather be as blind to the faults of a friend as
 a lover is to the defects in the face of his mistress or, if see them we
 must, might treat them with the indulgent tenderness of a father toward
 his child, interpreting bluntness as frankness and a hot temper as only
 an excess of high spirit.

 ‘But we follow just the opposite course and turn good qualities into
 faults, modesty into stupidity, prudence into trickiness. A fairer judg-
 ment would show us that virtues are more common than vices and
 would teach us to exchange pardon rather than censure.

 ‘A reasonable philosophy for a world of faulty men should not be
 over-strict. To break a friendship for some triﬂing breach of good
 manners is to lose all sense of proportion between crime and penalty.

 ‘ The Stoics, to be sure, teach in their paradoxical way that all faults '
 are sins and deserve the heaviest penalty. But this doctrine is repug-
 nant to our best feelings and opposed to all that we know of the gradual
 evolution of the moral code. A real understanding of the source of our
 moral sense makes it unreasonable to punish the slightest error with
 death, as the Stoic says he would do, if he were king. “And how
 now, my Stoic friend? Wishing that you were king? I thought
 another of your Paradoxes proved that you are a king already.” “ No,
 no, you don‘t understand. That means a potential king, not a king
 de facto.” “ Potential? What’s that? ” “Why, like Hermogenes,
 who doesn’t need to be singing all the time to prove that he’s a singer.
 Even when he isn’t singing, he‘s a potential singer. In the same
 way I’m a king, potentially.” “ Very well, I won't argue with you, but
 I don’t think much of Your Majesty, hustled by street boys on your
 way to the cheap baths. I will remain a private citizen and forgive as
 I hope to be forgiven." ’

 It is not probable that the subject of this satire was suggested by
 any particular set of circumstances. Roman society was censorious,
 and Horace was himself an object of criticism, but this is neither a
 satire, in the proper sense, nor an argument in self-defence. It is a
 broadly human plea for generosity toward one‘s friends. The treat-
 ment of the Stoics is not to be taken seriously, and it would not be fair
 to press too far the obvious modern analogies.

 1-2. vitinm: not vice, but de·
 fect, fault. -rogatiz contrasted
 with iniussi, both predicate.

 3. Sardns: with contemptuous
 emphasis. The Sardinians were
 in bad repute at Rome; cf. the
 saying, Sardi venales, alter altero
 nequior.

 4. Tigellius: a musician of the
 Ciceronian period, several times
 alluded to in Cicero‘s letters and
 in the scholiasts. Cicero speaks
 of him always as Sardus Tigellius,
 but his name was Hermogenes
 Tigellius, and it is unlikely that
 Sardus was accepted by him as a
 cognomen. He was an acquaint-
 ance of many persons of promi-
 nence, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra,
 Cicero, and the younger Caesar,
 but not, apparently, on terms of
 equality. He had died shortly
 before the second satire was writ-
 ten. He is to be distinguished
 from another Hermogenes Tigel-
 lius, still alive, also a musician and
 probably a freedman or adopted
 son of the former. The tone of

 Horace toward the elder Tigellius
 is not hostile, though not respect-
 ful; toward the younger he is dis-
 tinctly hostile (Sat. 1,4,72; 3, ιο,
 18, 80, 90). There are two places
 where the reference might be to
 either (1,3, 129; 1,9,25). - habe-

 Octavius took this name immedi-
 ately after the death of his great-
 uncle, in 44. The title Augustus
 was not given to him till 27. He
 is always referred to by Horace
 as Caesar, never as Octavianus,
 which could not be used in hex-
 ameter.—qul cogere posset : the
 words are not meant literally,
 but as a complimentary recogni-
 tion of his position and inﬂu-

 these words summarize the pro-

 The substance of the passage
 therefore is: ‘But if you had
 taken this ascetic philosopher
 at his word and given him a
 million or two, he would
 have turned spendthrift in a
 week.’

 a description of a man who had
 been dead some years, and all the

 in present time it would have been

 gave him a million; a week after-

 and more sweeping than the more
 exact masculine. Cf. Catullus, 9,

 -sliquis, mihi= merely the two
 conventional ﬁgures that Horace
 often employs to enliven his Sat-
 ires with bits of dialogue.-- Quid
 tu? how about yourself?

 21-23. These verses repeat in
 brief, with the added point of a
 double pun, the» essenoe of 1-20.
 Maenius corresponds to the critic,
 Novius to Tigellius, heus tu to
 quid tui (guard: . . . putasf is
 a slight expansion of nullane ka-
 bes w’tia? and egomet mi ignosco
 is a neater variation upon immo

 notas, ignotum, ignosco gains force
 from the double question: ‘ Which
 is it, Maenius, epto-ras or (gno-
 tum 1" ‘Neither,’ says Maenius;
 ‘it’s agno-sco.7 The scholiast
 gives a long account of a Maenius,
 but it has no point here, nor is it
 important to identify Novius with
 one of the persons mentioned in A
 Sat. 1, 6, 121 ; the names are only
 more vivid substitutes for aliquis

 dignusque notari: ‘a proper sub-

 ject for a satire.’

 “ Verses 1-24 introduce the sub-
 ject of the satire with an easy skill
 which Horace has nowhere sur-
 passed. The passage reads like
 the talk of a group of men sitting
 about the ﬁre at a club. There
 is no attempt to reproduce the
 exact form of dialogue, and the
 suggestion of dialogue in the in-
 troduction is intended only as
 an interpretation of the spirit of
 the passage. Some chance has
 brought up the oddities of musi-
 cal people, of which Tigellius
 affords an excellent illustration.
 The mention of his name leads
 easily to the amusing and not ill-
 natured analysis of the character
 of this much-ﬂattered and ex-
 travagant musical artist. But the
 characterization, though not really
 ill-natured, illustrates the incon-
 sistency of censuring others for
 failings which we excuse in our-
 selves, an inconsistency which is
 even more clearly apparent in
 the Maenius—Novius anecdote, and
 which furnishes a subject for the
 satirist. . ”

 inunctia: there are frequent refer-
 ences to this inﬂammation of the
 eyelids and to the use of eye-salve
 (Sat- I, s, 30; 51W- ι, ι, 29);
 both the disease and the remedy
 obscured for the time the power
 of vision—equal, aerpena: the
 eagle is still used in literature as a
 symbol of acuteness of sight; the
 attributing of the same quality to
 the serpent, common in Greek
 literature, was due to a supposed
 connection between δράκων and
 the‘ stem of δέρκομαι, to see.-
 Epiduurius refers to the story of
 the bringing of a sacred serpent
 from the temple of Aesculapius in
 Epidaurus to Rome. This is the
 use, frequent in Horace, of the
 deﬁnite and particular for the gen-
 eral. —pervideas: taken by many
 editors to mean examine sharply,
 making an intentional oxymoron
 with lzppus. But pervidere usu-
 ally means only to look at, and is
 here contrasted with cernis acu-

 lippus inunctis with aquila and
 serpens.

 38-54. ‘As the lover ﬁnds in
 the defects of his mistress only
 added beauties, and as the father
 calls his boy by a pet name which
 minimizes his physical weaknesses,
 so we should try to see the better
 side of our ﬁ'iends’ qualities.’

 Horace is here strengthening
 his argument by appealing to two
 well-recognized traits. The blind-
 ness of the lover was a common-
 place of philosophy (Plato, Rep.
 5,474 d; Lucretius, 4, 1160—1169;
 Ovid, Ars Am. 2, 657 Η.) and the
 giving of nicknames based upon
 physical peculiarities was so com-
 mon among the Romans that
 most of their family names, in~
 cluding those used in this passage
 (Paetus, Pullus, Varus, Scaurus),
 are derived from this custom.

 38. Illuc praevertamus, quod=
 let us turn rather to this fact, that
 . . .; i.e. ‘let us prefer to imitate
 the lover’s blindness.’

 39. decipiunt: are unnoticedby.
 Cf. fallere, latere, with acc. of the

 name.

 wish that we made the same mt:-

 42. virtue: ctltics, ethical phi-
 losophy. Cf. Carm. 2, 2, 17 ﬁi,
 Phraaten . . . numero beatorum
 eximit vertas-honestant cred-
 itablc, honorable. Though such
 blindness to obvious facts may be
 an error, yet it is so generous an
 error that philosophers, especially
 the Stoics, should have given it a
 name which would recognize its
 nobler side.

 43—48. This passage cannot be
 exactly translated; modern Eng-
 lish, in which physical deformities
 are ignored or relegated to the
 scientiﬁc vocabulary of surgeons,
 has no equivalents for pactus,
 pullus, varus, scaurus. Each of
 these words designates in an ex-
 tenuating way deformities which
 are more broadly described by the _
 corresponding words strabo, male

 the father speaks the word scaurus

 49-54. These lines contain the
 application of the foregoing illus-
 trations. Each of the four quali-
 ties mentioned may be regarded
 as a fault, but each has its good
 side, so that it may, upon a gen-
 erous interpretation, be considered
 a virtue. The words which express
 the overcritical interpretation are
 in the comparative degree, as if to
 suggest that the faults are only
 exaggerations of good qualities.

 49. Parcius z too stingy—frugi:
 economical, ‘ careful in money mat-
 ters.’

 49—51. ‘He sometimes thrusts

 himself forward too much (iactan-
 tior)and really makes an ass of
 himself (ineptus), but it is in the
 effort (postulat) to be entertain-
 ing) The best commentary on
 these qualities is in Cicero, de
 Orat. 2, 4, 17, ‘qui aut tempus
 quid postulet non videt aut plura
 (too much) loquitur aut se ostentat
 (= iactantior) . . . aut denique in
 aliquo genere aut inconcinnus aut
 multus est, is ineptus dicitur.’
 This sense of postulare, to expect,
 desire, almost= velle, is common
 in Plautus and should have fuller
 treatment in the Lexicons.

 51-52. ‘Too much inclined to
 be overbearing, and more free in
 speech than he ought to be.’ On
 its good side this quality should
 be regarded as merely frankness
 and fearlessness.

 ‚ 55—56. ‘But we follow a course
 exactly the opposite of this; in-
 stead of looking for the virtues
 which underlie faults, we seek for
 the faults that accompany virtues.’
 Of the two ﬁgures by which this
 is expressed, the ﬁrst, invertimus,
 is quite general; the second is
 derived from the soiling of a clean
 (simeram) jar by the incrustation
 deposited from sour wine. — cupi-
 mm: ale. we ﬁnd pleasure in it.

 56—58. The opposed interpre-
 tations are expressed by pairs of
 adjectives, put together without a
 connective. — Probus : honest ,· de·
 missum modest, quiet. Cicero uses
 the two words together (de Orat.
 2, 43, 182), contrasting them with
 acres, pertinaces. - pingui : some-
 what stronger than lardo.

 58-62. The virtus of these lines
 is less obvious than the preceding,
 and is therefore described more at
 length, before the point is reached
 in the pairs of contrasting adjec-
 tives.—nulli malo: maso-latum
 ﬂank, the ﬁgure being from the

 59

 military vocabulary.—inter: see
 note on I, I , 47.—-invidia, crimina z
 many allusions in the Satires show
 that Horace was himself exposed
 to envy and criticism by reason
 of his friendship with Maecenas.
 -sano, non incauto: a man of
 sense and not without prudence.
 - ﬁctum: insincere; cf. Cic. Lael.
 8, 26, where simulatus is used as
 a parallel.

 63-66. The quality here de-
 scribed, perhaps suggested by
 contrast with the ‘prudence’ of
 58—62, is that single-mindedness
 and absence of self-consciousness
 which is at times a most engaging
 characteristic, but at other times
 may become annoying thoughtless-

 69. urgetur: i.e. has the small-

 thought suggests the ﬁgure of
 weights balanced in the scales,
 which is more elaborately worked
 out in the following lines; so
 inseverit, 35, suggests vs. 37.

 70. cum: prep. governing

 born with faults (68) which no
 philosophy can wholly eradicate,
 it is reasonable that we should
 recognize the difference between
 the lighter and the heavier, and
 should not condemn all with an
 equal severity.’

 The ﬁgure of the scales (7o—

 weighed against virtues, suggests
 the weighing of one fault against
 another, and this recalls the Stoic
 doctrine that all faults are alike in
 heinousness. Against this doc-

 ral conclusion would be ⁴as hard
 as you can,’ but for this general
 comparison Horace substitutes a
 special allusion which has a point
 of its own. Ruso, unknown ex-
 cept from this reference, is a
 money-lender, keen in collecting
 his interest, but with a weakness
 for writing histories. His clever
 debtor, unable to meet his notes,
 pretends an interest in Ruso’s
 writings and so gets easy terms
 from the ﬂattered author. But
 the histories are so dull that to
 listen to them is as painful as to
 stand with outstretched neck await-
 ing the blow of the executioner,
 and Ruso’s debtors therefore avoid
 him even more persistently than

 62

 other debtors avoid their credit-

 96 E. The Paradoxes of the
 Stoics were doctrines which,
 though they transcended ordi-
 nary experience, were held to
 express essential truths. There
 is a brief review of them in
 Cicero, pro Mur. 29, 60 ﬁ'., where
 the particular Paradox here dis-
 cussed is stated thus: ‘omnia
 peccam esse paria; omne delic-
 tum scelus esse nefarium, nec
 minus delinquere eum qui gallum
 gallinaceum, cum opus non fuerit,
 quam eum qui patrem suffocaverit.’
 Against this Horace sets the re-
 sults of actual observation, en-
 forced by a condensed history,

 63

 from Epicurean philosophy, of the
 development of the ideas of right
 and wrong. The Stoic teaching
 is not unlike the Calvinistic doc-
 trine of sin—that the sinfulness
 of an act lies in the violation of
 the law of God, the particular
 details or consequences being im-
 material—while the attitude of
 Horace is that of the believers in
 evolutionary ethics.

 ut-clause conforms to the under-

 for the simple expression the iron-

 fearing. —pares res: = paria, 96.

 indirect form of the purpose of the
 Stoic philosopher: ‘I would do
 thus and so, if I had the power.’
 But the last thought is care-
 lessly expressed in the common
 phrase, ‘if I were king,’ and
 Horace seizes upon this phrase
 to turn the rest of the satire into
 a humorous ﬂouting of Stoic
 doctrine.

 124-326. This Paradox is thus
 stated by Cicero, pro Mur. 29,
 61: ‘solos sapientes esse, si dis-

 66

 Qui ?

 tortissimi, formosos, si mendicis-
 simi, divites, si servitutem serviant,
 reges; and is referred to by Lucil-
 ius, 1225 f. (Marx). The funda-
 mental truth which underlies the
 Paradox is that character makes
 the man, that character is the
 essential and circumstances are
 the accidents, a truth which
 Horace in other places (eg.
 Carm. 2, 2, I7 ff.) fully recog-
 nizes; here ’it suits his purpose

 their Paradox, even in its most
 extreme applications. —Qui? an

 says, the famous jurist (vafer is
 used of the law in Sat. 2, 2, 131)
 Alfenus Varus, consul in 39. He

 cobbler at Cremona, and the argu-

 no direct answer to the argument,
 but turns to other matters which
 form in the end a most conclu-

 There is no reference in this satire which ﬁxes the date precisely, and
 we are obliged to fall back upon general indications. The criticisms to
 which it is a reply were called forth by the sensational and personal
 tone of the early seventh and eighth satires, and especially of the
 second; in particular, vss. 91 ﬁ'. show that this was written after the
 second and, probably, very soon after it. Maecenas is not mentioned
 in this satire, as he is not referred to in the other earlier ones, though a
 personal mention would have been natural in 8, 8 and 14. Nor is there
 any reference to the group of distinguished friends whose approval is
 in the tenth satire the ﬁnal answer to the critics. This satire may
 therefore with probability be placed with 2, 7 and 8 of this book and
 with some of the Epodes, all written before Horace’s introduction to
 Maecenas in 38.

 The reference to Tigellius (vs. 72) is too vague to give any indica-
 tion of the date (cf. note on 1, 3⁷ 4).

 ‘The great Athenian writers of comedy were the founders of satire.
 After them came Lucilius, not less keen than they, but too careless and
 too profuse. His faults I desire to avoid, for mere quantity is not a
 merit; but the spirit of his satire I shall attempt to preserve. I am

  

 SERMONES [ι. 4, 3

 aware, however, that exposure of the weaknesses of men makes my
 writings unpopular, and I desire to say a word in self-defence.

 ‘In the ﬁrst place, I do not think that satire is poetry or should be
 judged by the standards of poetry. It lacks the imaginative inspiration
 and the lofty expression of poetry, and is, in this respect, like comedy,
 a mere reproduction in verse-form of ordinary talk on everyday subjects.

 ‘The main question, however, is whether the satirist deserves to be
 regarded with dislike and suspicion. You compare him to a detective,
 not noticing that you thereby compare yourself to a criminal, but the
 comparison fails because my notes are not taken for use in a court or
 for publication. You say that the satirist is a man of meanly critiml
 spirit, who ﬁnds pleasure in exhibiting the failings of others. But this
 also is untrue; mysatire is no more personal or serious than the rail-
 lery of a good talker at.a dinner table. It is in fact only the exercise
 of a habit of observation taught me by my good father, who without
 knowing the philosophy of books instructed me in a practical philoso-
 phy founded on observation. The only fault you can ﬁnd with me is
 that I write down my observations. But everybody nowadays writes;
 if you object to that, we’ll unite to condemn you and the penalty shall
 be that you shall turn writer yourself.’

 The connection of thought is less clearly indicated in this satire than
 in the ﬁrst or third ;. there is occasional sharpness of retort and there
 is little of the mellow humor of the later work. These are the marks
 of immaturity. The sensitiveness to criticism, also, is of the kind that
 decreases with experience.

 6. Hinc . . . pendet: upon them
 Lucilius is entirely dependent, it.
 as the context shows, they were
 his predecessors and models in
 the open ridicule of individuals,
 his warrant for the use of per-
 sonal satire. It does not mean
 that Roman satire, as a form of
 literature, was derived from or an
 imitation of Greek comedy.—C.
 Lucilius: see Introd.— hosce:
 = hos. In Plautus the forms
 in -ce are used only before
 vowels.

 7. mutatis . . . numeris: Lu-
 cilius wrote partly in iambics and
 trochaics, but the verse which he
 used most frequently and which
 became the traditional verse for
 satire was the dactylic hexameter,
 which is not employed in the

 drama-tantum not to be taken
 too strictly, for Lucilius of course
 did not use the dramatic form.
 The emphasis here is upon the
 satirical spirit.—facetus: origi-
 nally ‘brilliant or polished in
 speech’ (from fa-ri, to speak),
 and this is the meaning always
 in Plautus; cf. also Sat. I, 10,
 44„ malle atque facetum, of Ver-
 gil’s bucolic poetry. The mean-
 ing ‘humorous,’ ‘ facetious,‘ comes
 over into the adj. from the noun
 facetiae. It combines with emunc-
 tae naris to express the single idea
 ‘keen in words and in thought,’
 ‘sarcastic.’ The same idea is ex-
 pressed in Sat. 1, 10, 3 f., sale
 multo urbem defrzeuit.

 9. hoc: in this, referring to
 what follows, which is at the

 for doing something without eﬂ'ort,
 but it does not occur elsewhere;
 Quintilian, 12, 9, 18, in his actioni-

 standum est, seems to be a refer-
 ence to the opposite idea.

 -furnoz the poorer classes had
 their baking done in public ovens
 and got their water from the pub-

 crowds of slaves (pueros) and old
 women (anus) would be gathered.
 The whole involves a comparison:
 the satirist is no better than a
 scandalmonger, who retails his
 gossip to the meanest of the public.

 39—62. In these lines Horace
 gives the earliest indication of that
 interest in the theory of poetry
 which appears more plainly in Sat.
 1, 10 and 2, I and in the Epistles,
 and which culminated in the Ars
 Poetica. For various reasons the
 passage deserves special attention.
 It contains the observations of a
 conscious artist upon the art which
 he was practicing with success,

 74

 and such observations are always
 interesting. At this period of his
 life Horace was writing both Sat-
 ires and Epodes, and this passage
 reveals the effort that he was mak-
 ing to distinguish between the two
 forms and to assign to the Epodes
 those lyrical thoughts and emo-
 tions which he found incompatible
 with the conventional limitations
 placed upon satire by Lucilius.
 And, in themselves, the lines are
 an admirable illustration of the
 somewhat elusive and colloquial
 form of argument which Horace
 habitually employs. The sense,
 in brief, is this: ‘ Satire is verse,
 but not poetry, since it lacks the
 imaginative thought and the lofty
 expression which characterize true
 poetry and which remain even
 when the verse-form is destroyed.’

 3g. poetas: not attracted into the

 as relaxed (oratio soluta is the
 technical term; cf. dissolvas, 55;

 the satire had begun impersonally

 critic is addressed directly and
 replies for himself; the monologue
 becomes dialogue.

 65-66. Snlcius, Caprius: detec-

 the ﬁnes collected on evidence
 furnished by them. Such men
 were a necessary part of the R0-

 of the satirist to a detective was
 intentionally offensive. — libellis :

 Satires were not written for
 publication seems at ﬁrst sight
 irreconcilable with the fact that
 this satire is itself a reply to criti-
 cisms based upon a knowledge of
 the earlier Satires, especially the
 second. But the method of mul-
 tiplying copies by hand made it
 possible to limit the circulation of
 a poem, so that it might be some-
 what widely read without being
 oﬂ'ered for sale or put into general
 circulation. The collection and
 publication of the whole book was
 evidently a later decision.

 73. recito: the habit of giving
 private readings from one’s own
 works became later so common as
 to be ridiculous, and Horace here
 recognizes its possible exaggera-
 tions. But Vergil read parts of
 the Aeneid to Augustus and others,
 and Ovid (Tristia, 4, 10, 49) was
 present at a reading given by
 Horace.

 the reference in Sat. 1, IO, 26 to

 fact that light verse writing was
 a frequent amusement of educated

 Romans — Pliny gives a long list
 of famous names—and that it
 was especially characteristic of the
 Augustan Age, when politics no
 longer offered a career.

 143. Iudaei: the best commen-
 tary on this allusion is chap. 28
 of Cicero’s speech pro Flacco, in
 which he refers to the number and
 inﬂuence of the Jews in Rome
 (scis quanta sit manus, quanta
 concordia, quantum valeat in con-
 tionibus), to their religion (huic
 barbarae superstitioni) and their
 obstinate resistance to Roman
 ideals (istorum religio sacrorum
 asplendore huius imperii, gravi-
 tate nominis nostri, maiorum insti-
 tutis abhorrebat). To a Roman,
 who admitted the gods of for-
 eigners easily to his Pantheon, the
 desire of the Jew to make con-
 verts was wholly unintelligible.

 The evidence for the date of this satire is found in vs. 27—29; Mae-
 cenas and Cocceius (L. Cocceius Nerva) were making the journey to
 Brundisium on an important mission, to reconcile friends who were at
 variance, a mission which they had performed before. The aversi

 lations Were never clearly deﬁned and were in constant need of read-
 justment. In the year 40 B.C. an arrangement called the Treaty of
 Brundisium was made by Maecenas, representing Caesar, Asinius
 Pollio, representing Antonius, and Cocceius, as the friend of both
 sides. This explains soliti componere (29). In the following years,
 39-—38 B.C., Caesar was twice defeated by the ﬂeet of Sextus Pompeius
 and was obliged to call upon Antonius for aid. Antonius came to
 Brundisium in the spring of 39, but Caesar did not meet him at that
 time, or, so far as is known, send representatives to a conference. But
 in the autumn of 38, the diﬁiculties with Sextus Pompeius increasing,
 Maecenas was sent to Athens to confer with Antonius. With him went
 Fonteius Capito, as a friend of Antonius, and Cocceius, presumably to
 be a referee, as on the previous occasion, and the three ambassadors
 were accompanied on the overland journey to the port of Brundisium
 by a party of literary friends, Horace, Vergil, Plotius Tucca and Varius
 -(the two friends to whom the publication of the Aeneid was intrusted
 after the death of Vergil), and a Greek rhetorician, Heliodorus. The
 satire was probably written soon after the date of the journey, late in
 38 or early in 37.

 The connection of thought is simple; the satire is a rather bare
 recital of the events of the journey, with some description of humorous
 episodes and adventures. The route can be easily followed on a map
 and the daily stages are for the most part indicated. But Horace was
 not writing a guidebook of the well-known route, and he has intention-
 ally paraphrased the names of some places (24, 37, 45, 79 f., 87) and
 has used phrases which leave it uncertain whether the party spent a
 night at Anxur, at Capua, or at Beneventum. The journey was made
 partly on foot (though this is not certain), partly in a canal boat, but
 chieﬂy by riding or driving. The distance was about 340 English
 miles, the time from twelve to ﬁfteen days.

 The satire has a certain accidental interest from the glimpses it gives
 of the manner of traveling in the year 38 B.C., and it contains a few
 interesting personal allusions (27-29, 32—33, and especially 39—44), but
 it is for the most part made up of trivialities. It falls short to a sur-
 prising degree of the account which we should expect Horace to give of
 a fortnight’s association with a group of men so cultivated and so emi-
 nent. There are two explanations of the limitations of the satire. In
 the ﬁrst place, personal biography and reminiscence are modern; they
 had not made a place in ancient literature. The nearest approach to
 them would be in books like Caesar’s Commentaries or Cicero‘s account
 of his consulship—both in reality political pamphlets—or in the

 85

 3, 5, I] HORA'I‘I
 collection of Cicero’s letters and of his witticisms. There are no true
 parallels in Latin literature to the many books of personal reminiscence
 which enrich modern literature. In the second place, Horace was
 deliberately attempting a very different task; he was writinga satire
 which was intended to be a close parallel to the similar description of a
 journey in the Third Book of Lucilius, and he has therefore been more
 closely bound by tradition in this satire than in any other. He was
 deliberately following a particular model and setting himself and his
 art in the closest possible comparison with the work of Lucilius. Un-

 fortunately, the fragments of the satire of Lucilius are too scanty—
 about 50 verses, 98-147 in Marx—to enable us to follow the corre-

 spondence into details.

 2. hospitio: the well-to-do Ro-
 man had friends or connections in
 many places by whom he was re—
 ceived as a guest (cf. 38, 50), so
 that he was rarely obliged to de-
 pend upon the public inns, and the
 inns were in consequence rather
 humble places of entertainment
 (cf. 71 m).

 3. longe doctissimns: a humor-
 ous and not unfriendly superlative ;
 cf. vss. 39 and 50. A considerable
 part of the humor of the satire is in

 ” the form of obvious exaggerations

 of discomforts(4, 7, 80, 88, 91, 95).

 4. nautis: hoatmen, employed
 upon the cana] which ran through
 the Pomptine marshes from Forum

 Appi to Feronia. — cauponibus

 53-70. The custom of inviting
 semi-professional jesters to enliven
 the conversation of the dinner
 table, a custom which'has' pre-
 vailed more or less in all societies,
 is alluded to in many Roman
 writers from Plautus down. The
 jesters were of all degrees, from
 the buffoon or the mere butt of
 practical jokes to the more reﬁned
 wit and story-teller. ' Examples of
 both kinds are mentioned in Sat.
 2, 8, Porcius, who could eat whole

 91

 cakes at a gulp, and Vibidius and
 Balatro, hangers-on of Maecenas
 and leaders of the joking, but not
 buﬁ'oons.

 This passage is the record of a
 contest of wits between two such
 parasites. Sarmentus is described
 at some length in a. scholium to
 Juvenal, 5, 3, and was evidently a
 well-known person; he had been
 a slave, was perhaps at this time a
 freedman, had become a scriba,
 and was small and somewhat
 effeminate in appearance. He
 represents the type of scurra, the
 more polished wit. MessiusCicir-
 rus (κίκιρρος, a ﬁghting-cock) is
 the clown, an Oscan, large and
 clumsy, with his face disﬁgured by
 a scar. He is a countryman,
 brought in for the occasion to be
 pitted against the city-bred Sar-
 mentus, who was in the train of
 Maecenas, perhaps as a secretary.

 53-55. Musa: in epic style.—
 quo patre natus: as in Homer, be-
 fore two heroes engage iu ﬁght,
 the genealogy of each is recited.
 But in this case the heroic de-
 mand (quo patre natus) cannot be
 met; ‘of Messius the glorious

 This is clearly a variation on the

 awkward and the comparison to a

 unicorn and, below, to the Cyclops
 requires that the scar should have
 been in the middle; the text must
 be regarded as quite doubtful.]

 62. Campanum in morbum :
 some disease, not understood
 even by the scholiasts, which
 was thought to be the cause of
 the scar. Campanus contains the
 same kind of slur as Osci, 54.’

 63. saltaret . . Cyclopa: shoula

 dance ; accus. of the inner ob-
 ject.

 ugly And the scar would represent
 the one eye of the Cyclops.—co—

 by giving the substance of the re—

 between 38 and 33 B.C. The upper limit is ﬁxed by the allusion in
 vss. 54 ff. to Horace’s introduction to Maecenas, which was probably
 not earlier than 38 B.C. On the other hand, the second half of the
 satire would certainly have contained some allusion to the Sabine
 form, which came into Horace’s possession in 33, if the satire had been
 written after that date.

 ‘Your high position, my dear Maecenas, as a man of noble family,
 evidently does not seem to you to justify you in looking down upon
 other men, upon me, for instance, a freedman’s son. On the contrary,
 your admission of all freeborn citizens to social equality seems to
 express your belief that character, not birth, is the proper basis of a
 claim to public recognition. And, in fact, even the ordinary voter,
 prone as he is to be dazzled by noble birth, sees this truth and acts
 upon it. But we, whose vision is clearer, ought to see still deeper and
 to distinguish between social recognition and political advancement.
 A political ambition, like that of Tillius, not improperly raises questions
 of family and of inherited ﬁtness for public oﬁ‘ice. But, for me, I have
 no political ambition and the oﬁ‘ice which I once held in the army of
 Brutus came to me by mere chance; I will not even take the trouble to
 defend myself against the criticisms which it excited. But my friend-
 ship with you is no Chance; two sponsors whom I am proud to name,
 Vergil and Varius, introduced me to you and after careful deliberation
 you accepted me as a friend, judging me not by my father’s tank, but
 by my own character.

 ‘And yet that very character which has won your esteem was my
 father’s gift to me. He was a poor man, a freedman, yet he gave me

 such an education as a knight or a senator might have given to his
 son, attending me himself to guard me against the dangers of the city,
 not deterred by the fear of educating me above my station. I should
 be mad to wish that I had had a different father. I will not even say,
 as some do, that I was not responsible for my humble parentage. On
 the contrary, I would not exchange my father for any other, not even
 for one who had sat in the curule chair and worn the purple.

 ‘For, after all, I prefer my quiet life. No bother about money, no
 formal calls to make, no swarm of servants, no fuss. I stroll about
 town as I please and watch the sights of the streets; I go home to a
 plain dinner and a good night’s sleep, untroubled by the thought of
 early business engagements in the morning. I read or write, I take a
 little exercise, I have a light lunch and an afternoon of leisure. That’s
 a great deal more comfortable than the life of the people who think
 they have a position to maintain.’ _

 This satire belongs in subject and treatment with the third, the
 fourth, and the tenth. It springs directly out of the circumstances of
 Horace's life at the time it was written and marks another step in his
 progress from the earlier years of rebellious obscurity to the assured
 position of the Second Book. His friendship with men of rank, his
 acceptance by Maecenas, and, in particular, the publication of the
 account of the journey to Brundisium had revived the old criticisms
 which his position in the army of Brutus bad aroused and had given
 new grounds for suspecting him of social and political ambitions. The
 satire is in form a disclaimer of such ambitions, while in substance it is
 a defence of the friends who had accorded him social recognition and a
 very manly and dignified declaration of pride in his father’s wisdom and
 of contentment with his own quiet life.

 upon the liberality of the admis-

 seemed to him, as, indeed, it well
 might, a natural limitation, to be
 mentioned only incidentally.—

 in Roman history— plebeians have
 been elected to the consulship, and
 patricians have been nobodies’;
 (3) ‘if the common voter can
 judge so correctly, then you and
 I should certainly not be misled
 by the accident of birth.’ If
 Horace had been trying to use
 the forms of precise reasoning,
 only the ﬁrst of these statements
 would have been subordinated to

 Roman Forum, though it is inten-

 Forum was the oﬂicial center of
 all political and public life, the
 place where the funeral proces-
 sions of great men, with their
 horns and trumpets, paused to
 listen to ,the laudatio, and it was
 at the same time the principal busi-

 The event which is the subject of this satire occurred at Clazomenae
 in Asia Minor, while Brutus was acting as governor of Macedonia and
 Asia, either in 43 B.C. or in the ﬁrst half of 42, before the battle of
 Philippi. \ .

 But the date of composition is less certain; the satire may have
 been written immediately after the incident or it may be a reminiscence
 of the campaign written out at any time between 41, when Horace
 returned to Rome, and 35 B.C., when the ﬁrst book of satires was pub-
 lished. As the satire itself contains no speciﬁc allusions to ﬁx the

 III

 r, 7, ι] HORATI
 date of composition, there is left only the rather uncertain method of
 adjusting its general tone to what may be supposed to have been Horace’s
 attitude of mind at one date or another. These indications point to the
 earliest date; the tone toward Rupilius is different from his general
 attitude of loyalty toward his companions in that ill-fated campaign;

 , the allusion in vs. 3 to the widespread circulation of the story would be

 pointless ﬁve years after the occurrence; the reference to Brutus in vss.
 33 ﬂ'., which in any case seems flippant, is easier to understand if the
 lines were written before the battle of Philippi and left standing as a
 part of the record, than if we suppose them to have been written with
 deliberation after the tragic death of Brutus. And, in general, the tone
 of the satire is distinctly less mature and thoughtful than the tone of
 Satires 3, 4, 6. There is a certain crudeness and harshness in it, a
 certain sensationalism, a failure to reach the principles of conduct which
 underlie particular events; in these respects it is like Satires 2 and 8
 and is to be classed with them as belonging to the earliest period of
 Horace’s work. It is as an example of the work of that period—a
 better example than either Satire 2 or 8--that it is here provided with
 a oommentary.

 ’ The course of the thought is so simple as to need no paraphrase.

 1. P. Rupilius Rex of Praeneste
 had been an adherent of Pompey’s
 party and was praetor at the time
 of Caesar‘s death. He was pro-
 scribed by Antony and Octavius
 and took refuge with Brutus,
 who gave him, as a man of some
 prominence, a place on his staff
 (vs. 25). The cognomen Rex
 was common in his family.—
 Proscripti: in cohtrast with Regis.
 -Rupili pus atque venenum: a
 parody of the epic phrases like

 There is no allusion in this satire deﬁnite enough to ﬁx the date.
 The plot of ground which is the scene had been a burial-place, and was
 afterward acquired by Maecenas and used as the site for his palace and
 gardens. But the date when he acquired the land is not known. Nor
 is it clear that the land is in the possession of Maecenas either at
 the time when the events are represented as occurring or at the'later
 time when the garden god tells the story. The spot cannot be thought
 of as still in use for burial, sincethe ﬁgure of Priapus stands there, and,
 on the other hand, the gathering of bones (vs. 22) and the selection
 of the spot by two witches as a place for incantations is scarcely com-
 patible with its being a'private garden. Apparently the events are
 thought of as having occurred while the transformation from burial-
 place to garden was still incomplete. Verses 14-16 allude to a later
 stage, but it is strange that there should be no direct allusion to Mae-
 cenas, to whom in later satires Horace refers with such evident pride
 and pleasure, if he already owned the land and had built his great
 house there.

 The satire evidently belongs in the same period as Epodos 5 and 17,
 and seems to be referred to in vss. 47, 55 and 77 of the latter Epode.
 But neither of these poems can be dated with certainty. In the

 116

 SERMONES [1, 8, 9
 absence of data, on the general grounds of tone and manner- the lack
 of real humor, the coarseness, the cynicism — the satire may be placed
 with 2 and 7 of this book in the group of earlier writings.

 The fact that the speaker is the ﬁgure of the garden god Priapus
 gives to the satire a certain resemblance to the Priapea, of which we
 have a collection, but in substance this is a satire upon the kind of
 incantations described by Vergil in Eclogue 8. On the personal side
 it is an attack upon a certain Canidia, who is also savagely attacked in
 Epode 5 and ironically ridiculed in Epode 17, and who is mentioned
 in several places in the Satires and Epistles. The scholiast says that
 her real name was Gratidia, that she was a seller of drugs, a witch and
 a poisoner. How much of this is fact we do not know, but undoubtedly
 a real person is referred to under the name. The hostility with which
 Horace pursues her is distinctly unpleasant, and this poem and Epodes
 5 and 17 reveal him onI his least admirable side.

 This satire was written between 38 and 35 n.c., later than the ﬁrst
 group, Satires 2, 7, and 8, but before Satire 1 and probably before ιο.
 There is no allusion which makes a more precise dating possible and,
 as is usually the case where distinct allusions are lacking, there is
 nothing in the satire which would gain in interpretation if a more pre-
 cise date could be ﬁxed.

 In form the satire is an account of a morning walk in which Horace
 was joined by a mere acquaintance, who desired to cultivate a closer
 intimacy with him, in order, as ﬁnally appeared, to secure through him
 an introduction to Maecenas. Various attempts to shake him off were
 unsuccessful and an appeal to a passing friend was without eﬁ'ect, until
 chance intervened to save the poet. In grace and lightness of tone the
 satire is equaled only by some of the odes. The struggle between
 politeness and the desire to be free, the humorous consciousness of the
 joke upon himself, the happily conceived dramatic form, reaching a
 climax in the encounter with Fuscus—all these make it unnecessary
 to look for an underlying purpose. But a secondary motive was
 doubtless the opportunity which the story afforded of returning to the
 theme of the sixth satire and of showing again how ill-founded was
 the suspicion that Horace was seeking social advancement through his
 acquaintance with Maecenas.

 ι. Via Sacra? the principal
 street of the city, running from
 the Esquiline past the Palatine,
 along one side of the Forum. It
 was the street which Horace would
 naturally take in going from the
 residence part of the city to the
 Tiber. —aicut . . . mos: cf. I, 6,
 112, I22; with ibam, ,not with

 2. nugarnm: wenn; almost a
 technical term for light lyric

 poems, eg. Catull. r,4.—totus: so
 omnis in hoc sum, Epist. 1, 1, 1 3.

 3. notus . . . tantum: i.c. a
 mere acquaintance. The person
 cannot be identiﬁed, nor is it at
 all likely that Horace had in mind
 a deﬁnite individual or was re-
 counting the events of an actual
 experience. His purpose was
 rather to draw a typical picture
 of the Social Struggler, without
 direct reference to any individual.

 4. arreptae seizing my hand, -

 with a show of cordiality and in-
 timacy. - dulcissime rerum: my
 dearest fellow,- a very familiar
 form of greeting. rerum is fre-
 quently used as a generalizing
 addition, especially with a super-
 lative. It is of the same nature as
 the use of a gen. plur. with a neut.
 sing. pron., quidquid hominum.

 5. The reply is made up of
 polite phrases which, from the
 frequency of their use, are mere
 formulas with no more meaning
 than the English ‘Very well,
 thank you; I hope you are well.’
 —ut nunc est: all *things consid-
 ered, as times go.-cupio . . . via:
 a common phrase of politeness,
 which appears in various forms
 in dialogue.

 6. adsectaretur: after speaking
 the words of vs. 5, Horace started
 to walk on.—-Numquid visa a
 common phrase used in taking
 leave of another person; formula
 abeundi, Donatus calls it. It is
 very frequently used in Plautus
 and Terence.—0ccupo: i.c. he
 got in the words numquid ’νὼ-Ρ

 hint that he wished to go on.

 7. Noris: = noveris. Ordina-
 rily the phrase numquid wir! ex-
 pects no reply, but occasionally
 (Trin. 192, Capt. 191, M G. 575)
 the person addressed takes the
 question literally, as here, and
 replies with a verb in the suij.,
 as if with 7/010,- ‘yes, there is; I
 should like to have you make my
 acquaintance.‘ — docti sumus : I’m
 a literary man,’ ‘ I’m a man of cul-
 ture.’ doctus was used especially
 of the newer school of poets, those
 who followed the Alexandrian mod-
 els; it became a kind of party cry,
 employed by the new school as a -
 term of honor and by their oppo-
 nents as a term of ridicule. Hor-
 ace was distinctly of the opposite
 school (cf. Sat. I, 10, 19) and the
 person is therefore represented as
 offering, as an inducement to
 further acquaintance, a reason
 which would, in fact, lead Horace
 to avoid him.

 7 f. Pluris hoc . . . eris: Islzall
 value you all tlte more for that, tic.
 ‘because you are doctm’; polite-
 ness struggles with irony.

 8. Misere: awfully,- so below,

 in Plautus and Terence.

 The ﬁnal syllable is long, as fre-
 quently in the perf. indic. in
 Plautus.

 22. Si bene me novi: a condi-
 tion in form only; as sure as I
 know myself. -Viscume there
 were two brothers of this name,
 both literary men and friends of
 Horace and Maecenas. They are
 mentioned with honor in Sat. 1, ιο,
 83 and one of them was a guest at
 the dinner described in Sat. 2, 8.
 - Varium: see note on r, 5, 40.

 23 E. To any one who knew
 Horace well—and this satire is
 intended especially for the amuse-
 ment of his intimate friends—it
 would be plain that the selection
 of these three accomplishments as
 recommendations to his favor
 was, like the mention of doctus in
 vs. 7, a most comical blunder.
 He particularly disliked rapid and
 profuse verse writing (cf. l, 4,
 n ii, 17 f.); he regarded dancing
 as scarcely decent (Sat. 2, 1, 24 f.) ;
 and his opinion of singing in
 general and of Hermogenes in
 particular is plainly implied in Sat.
 1, 3, 1 ff. —The prose order of the
 last phrase would be ego canto
 quod et Hermogenes invideat.

 26 if. Interpellandi locus: ltere
 was my chance to break in. The
 context shows that Horace had
 invented, as he hoped, a new ex-
 pedient for getting rid of his per-
 severing friend, but the exact
 nature of the plan is not at ﬁrst
 sight apparent. The use of inter·
 pellandi shows that it was not
 connected with the remarks in vs.
 22—25; the words quis [=quibus]
 te salvo est opus must mean that
 he was going to point out some
 serious danger which would be in-
 curred in accompanying him, and
 the mention of dependent relatives
 is an elaborate provision to antici-
 pate a possible declaration from
 the other that he did not fear
 danger. All these combine to
 indicate that Horace was prepar-
 ing to say that the friend on whom
 he was going to (all had a con-
 tagious disease, exposure to which
 would be almost certainly fatal.
 It is an added touchof humor
 that Horace represents himself as
 so discouraged by the first slight
 failure—for the dependent rela-
 tives were not essential to the
 plan—that he surrendered in de-
 Spalt.

 39. valeo stare: am strong
 enough to stand, as was customary

 is of course quite inconsistent with

 43. Maecenas quomodo tecum:

 [The diﬂ'iculty which all com-

 these lines and in assigning them

 the fad that Horace is not report-

 giving only the main points, omit-

 necting links of the thought.
 This is a favorite method with
 him (eg. Sat. ι, 4, 52 ἦ, 85 ﬁ'.,
 1, 6, 17-25) and it suits perfectly
 the informal style of the Semnones,
 but it sometimes leaves the

 mentioned in the closing lines would indicate a late date, and the
 general tone is that of an epilogue to the whole collection, as the ﬁrst
 satire is an introduction to the whole. This interpretation also har-
 monizes with the last line of the satire (see notes).

 ‘It is quite true thatI said that Lucilius was a rough verse writer.
 His power as a satirist I acknowledge, but that alone does not make a
 poet. Many other qualities are necessary to a poetic style, brevity,
 variety, wit, such polished wit as is found in the Old Comedy, of which,
 indeed, some of my critics seem never to have heard. The mingling
 of Greek with Latin in Lucilius is not a merit, but a defect; no serious
 Roman writer mixes the two languages or writes in Greek at all.

 ‘The grand style I leave to others to attempt, successfully or not.
 My aim is less ambitious. The ﬁelds of comedy and tragedy, of epic
 and bucolic poetry, are well occupied and I have turned to satire, not,
 however, to be the rival of Lucilius or to lessen his glory. But it is
 true that I have mentioned his defects, as he had noticed the defects
 of Ennius and Accius. The copiousness of Lucilius and his lack of
 ﬁnish are real defects, which, if he were writing now, he would himself
 perceive and correct.

 ‘For ﬁnish of style appeals to the only public worth considering.
 Hermogenes may not like my work, but if Plotius and Varius, Maecenas
 and Vergil, approve, I need no other defence and can publish this book
 of satires without misgivings.’

 SERMONES [ι, ιο

 In the fourth satire Horace had defended himself against the charge
 that he was malicious and was seeking notoriety. The reply was in
 general direct and convincing, but in the course of his argument he
 happened to say (vss. 6-13) that his prototype, Lucilius, had written
 too profusely and with too little attention to ﬁnish. This chance re-
 mark — which is abundantly justiﬁed by the extant fragments of
 Lucilius—had brought upon him some censure from that school of
 literary critics in Rome whose cardinal doctrine was the excellence
 of the early Latin poetry, and ,had at the same time exposed him to the
 less sincere attacks of others who seized the opportunity to renew their
 personal and unfriendly criticisms. This satire is a reply to both
 classes. To the serious admirers of early Latin poetry he. replies with
 a serious discussion of the nature and causes of the defects of Lucilius
 and with candid praise of his merits. To the little clique of personal
 enemies he scarcely replies at all, brushing them aside with contemptu-
 ous brevity and twitting them (17-19) with their ignorance of the very
 poetry about which they were pretending to be solicitous.

 Preijxed to the text of this satire in some Mss. are eight verses: —-

 Lucili, quam sis mendosus, teste Catone,

 defensore tuo, pervincam, qui male factos

 emendare parat versos; hoc lenius ille,

 quo vir est melior, longe subtilior illo,

 qui multum puer et loris et funibus udis

 exhortatus, ut esset opem qui ferre poetis ’

 antiquis posset contra fastidia nostra,

 grammaticorum equitum doctissimus. Vt redeam illuc:

 These lines contain Horatian phrases (cf. loris et funibus with
 Epod. 4, 3, Epist. 1, 16, 47) and opinions (cf. vs. 7 with Epist. 2, 3,
 18 m); the reference to P. Valerius Cato, though not exactly identical
 with the statement in Sueton.de Gram. 2, is a similar bit of gram-
 matical tradition; the satirical allusion in vss. 5 ﬂ'. is obscure and con-

 _ tradictory, but comes evidently from the same school of literary and

 personal gossip; the phrasing is stiff (hoc lenius ille, ille and illo refer-
 ring to different persons, the apposition of dodim'mu: to qui), and the
 joining of the lines to vs. 1 of the satire by the words ut redeam illuc is
 very awkward. These facts all point to one conclusion, that the verses
 were written by a grammarian who saw in the abruptness of nempe dixi
 an opportunity to perpetuate a hit of his own learned satire by preﬁxing
 it to the text of Horace. ’

 104 and membrana, Sat. 2, 3, 2.

 5. sicu, on Mal principle, by

 6. Laberi: Decimus Laberius

 was a knight, who had died some
 ten years before the date of this
 satire. He was one of two or
 three successful writers of mimes,
 popular farces which were put
 into literary form in the Cicero—
 nian period. About I 50 lines or
 fragments from Laberius are pre-
 served (see Ribbeck, Com. Rom.
 Fragm.², pp. 279 iii), including a
 large part of the prologue spoken “
 by Laberius when he was com-
 pelled by Caesar to act in one of
 his own farces. Some of the lines
 of this are well known : -——

 Ego bis tricenis innis actis sine nota

 Equés Romanus é Lare egressus
 meo

 Domum revertar mimus.

 Necesse est multos timeat quem multi*
 timent.

 But such farces were of course
 not pulchra poemata.

 7. .Ergo: the mere mention of
 Laberius is enough to prove that
 witty verse is not necessarily
 poetry. -diducere rictumz a
 slightly contemptuous colloquial-
 ism; to make your hearer- grin.

 -—-Catullum: C. Valerius Catullus,
 one of the four great Roman poets,
 inferior to Horace in sanity and

 the only allusion to him in Horace,

 not be denied that the allusion is
 slighting in tone.

 ao. Graeca Latinis: to judge by
 the extant fragments the Greek

 a slight ﬂavor of the sweet Greek

 native Falernian; cf. Carm. 1, 20,

 held Greek wine.

 25 f. ‘Are you not thinking too

 Would you mix Greek with Latin

 28. Pedius Poplicolaz perhaps a
 Mother of Messalla (vs. 85), who
 had been adopted by Q. Pedius,
 a nephew of Julius Caesar. Al-
 most nothing is known of him,
 but Horace uses him here as a
 type of the great lawyer.

 29. Corvinus: M. Valerius Mes-
 salla Corvinus, the friend of Ti-
 bullus and one of the important
 personages of the Augustus period,
 distinguished as an orator. It is
 known that he took special pains
 (exsudet) to preserve a pure Latin

 30. foris : from abroad, from the

 Canusium and in Apulia generally
 both Greek and Latin (or, earlier,

 ⁸>Oscan) were native languages, as

 both German and French are na-

 seemed odd to a Roman, who was

 probably, also, neither language

 is somewhat elliptical; ‘ giving up
 Greek, therefore, and leaving to
 others their high and mighty epics,
 I turn to a humbler style.’ —
 Alpinus: this satirical side-stroke
 would have been immediately in-
 telligible to Horace’s contempora-
 ries. Probably Alpinus is a nick-
 name for M. Furius Bibaculus, the
 author of a poem on Gaul from
 which the bombastic line [luppi-
 tar], hibernas cana nive conspuit
 Λιβία· is quoted, Sat. 2, 5, 41. He
 wrote also an epic which included
 the killing of Μ emnon by Achilles,
 here alluded to with a play upon
 the double meaning of iugulat,
 ‘murders.’ The phrase dejingit . . .
 caput, ‘ misshapes the muddy head
 of the Rhine,’ contains a similar
 play upon some passage in the poem
 on Gaul, but the point is lost to us.

 Terentius Varro, called Atacinus
 from the river Atax, in southern

 Lucilius.’ It was an accepted
 doctrine of literary history that
 Lucilius was the inventor of satire,
 that is, was the ﬁrst to put it into
 hexameter and give it the distinct
 form which it thereafter retained.
 — The thought of these verses, 48-

 66. quam . . . auctorz the
 thought is altogether general;
 carmen is not satire and the auctor
 is not Lucilius or Ennius. The
 statement of Quintilian (Io, 1, 93),
 satira tota nostra est, is, in a
 way, correct, but it represents an
 entirely different literary tradition
 from that which Horace is follow-
 ing. His doctrine, expressed with
 an even exaggerated emphasis in 1,
 4, 1-6, was that satire came directly
 from the Greeks of the Old Comedy;
 in fact, the error of underestimating
 the force and value of the purely
 Italic inﬂuences runs through all
 his literary criticism. With the
 opening words of 1, 4 in mind-
 and they are distinctly in his mind
 all through this satire— he could
 not have called satire rude et

 Graecis intactum carmen. The
 thought is quite different: ‘Lu-
 cilius did not invent satire out
 of nothing; the way had been
 already prepared by the Greeks
 and he learned from them. I
 grant, therefore, that he had a
 certain degree of polish, more, of
 course, than a writer composing
 some entirely new (rude) kind of
 poetry, some poetry untouched by
 the Greeks, would have had, more

 Horace were in the curriculum of
 schools in the time of Juvenal
 (7, 226 f.). Horace, of course, did
 not, as is sometimes said, ‘ dread

 a humorous way, ‘do not aim at
 popularity; don’t try to be one of
 the “ best sellers.” ’

 LIBER SECVNDVS

 The Second Book of the Satires was published in 30 B.C., ﬁve years
 after the First Book, and the changes which the interval had produced
 in the temper and in the art of Horace are quite evident; his tone is
 less personal and more mellow and he has adopted the dialogue form
 instead of the monologue. In both respects the change is an advance.
 The earlier satires, with all their geniality, are touched here and there
 with sensationalism, and even the later work betrays at times a certain
 uneasiness about his own position and success. But by the year 30
 B.C. Horace, now about thirty-ﬁve years of age, had won recognition as a
 writer. He was secure in the esteem of a circle of friends ; he had accom-
 modated himself, not indeed without difﬁculty, but quite sincerely, to
 the great political changes which he had at ﬁrst opposed, and he writes
 like a man at peace with himself and with his world. He is not less
 serious; in his treatment of philosophy he is more serious; but he is
 less insistent, less urgent, and his touch is lighter. With this change in
 tone the change in form, from monologue to dialogue, and especially to a
 dialogue in which Horace himself plays only a subordinate part, is quite
 in harmony. A tendency toward informal dialogue is evident in some
 ofthe satires ofthe First Book (e.g., 1, 1, 30 5.; I, 4, 38 E), but the step
 from this to the formal dialogue of 2, I and 2, 5 is a long one, and the
 change was undoubtedly regarded by Horace as a distinct advance in
 the form of satire.

 I

 There are no allusions in this satire which ﬁx the date of composi-
 tion. The reference to the Parthians (vs. 15) is entirely general and
 might have been made before the battle of Actium, while Antonius was
 still master of the East. But it is probable that this satire was written
 after the rest of the book was completed, in accordance with the custom
 which Horace had begun in Sat. I, 1 and which he afterward followed
 in Epod. 3, 1, Carm. 1, 1, and Epist. 1, ι. This would ﬁx the date about
 30 B.C., after the battle of Actium, to which Caesaris invicti (vs. 13)
 may be an allusion. '

 143

 HORATI

 ‘Trebatius, people say that my satire is worthless. What shall I do
 about it?— Keep still !-—What, not write at all?— Yes. — By Jove,
 you may be right. But I can’t go to sleep. — Can’t sleep? Take some
 exercise and drink a bottle of wine just before bed-time and you will
 sleep perfectly well. Or, if what you mean is that you can⁷t stop writing,

 _ then write about Caesar; that is work that will pay you.—I wish I

 could, my dear sir, but Iam not equal to describing battles—Then
 write about his justice and his energy. -— Some other time, per-
 haps; just now I don’t think I will try it. —- It would be a great deal
 better than the things you do write, which make enemies on all sides.
 —I can’t help myself. Writing is my hobby. I have ﬁghting blood
 in my veins, as Lucilius had in his. But I never attack; I simply de·
 fend myself with my natural weapon, as a bull does with his horns. I can’t
 help myself; writeI must.—You won’t live long if you stick to that
 course. Some of your great friends will turn a cold shoulder to you.—‘—
 What, did Luciliüs’s friends desert him? I am not as great a man
 as he was, but if any man attacks me, he will ﬁnd that I am no easy
 prey— unless, of course, you advise differently. -No, I don‘t think I
 can say anything against that. But there are libel laws for the writers
 of bad verses. -— Bad verses! Yes, but mine are not bad; they are very
 good. Can I be sued for writing good versesi—Certainly not. Good
 poetry is above all law.’ ⁷

 In issuing a second collection of writings in the same style as that by
 which he had already won both friends and enemies, Horace thought it
 well to preface it with a further defence of satire, continuing the subject
 of 1, 4 and 3, 30. But as 1, 10 is at once less serious and more assured
 than I, 4, so this satire is less obviously argumentative than 1, 10. Its
 underlying purpose is self-defence and explanation, but under the cover
 of pure burlesque. It represents a consultation between Horace and his
 legal adviser, C. Trebatius Testa. The latter is well known to us
 through the group of letters addressed to him by Cicero (ad Fam. 7, 6—
 22) ; he was a distinguished jurisconsult anda man of much humor, and
 therefore a suitable ﬁgure for a burlesque consultation. The dialogue
 is managed with great skill; Trebatius, in a dry, legal manner, gives
 prudent advice, which Horace rejects as fast as it is given, arguing with
 much heat in favor of the course that he had already determined upon
 before he went through the form of consulting the lawyer. The argu-
 ments, too, by which Horace defends his course are all farcical: Mi-
 lonius gets drunk and dances, therefore I may write satire; the bull
 gores, the wolf bites, and Scaeva poisons his mother, therefore I may
 use my satire to wound and poison. From beginning to end there is

 the defeat of the Parthian cavalry.

 selected merely as conspicuous
 among the enemies of Rome,
 without reference to particular
 campaigns.

 2, 27. That quotation is intro-
 duced by ego si risi and the argu·
 ment, there seriously made, is that
 the line is a harmless jest. It is
 almost a necessary inference that
 here also the verse quoted by Tre-
 batius was regarded by Horace as
 in fact quite harmless. This could
 be true only if the persons referred
 to were either ﬁctitious, as the
 name Pantolabus certainly is, or
 already notorious, as was probably
 the case with Nomentanus (cf.
 1, 1, 102 note).

 part of the wish; ‘may I be able
 to put it away and let it rust; ’
 almost the same as vagina tectus.

 44-46. In these lines the hu-
 morous exaggeration and affected
 solemnity of the satire reach a
 climax. Whatever Horace may
 have been in his earlier years, he
 was at this time as far removed as
 possible from a bragging swash-
 buckler, whose war-cry (clamo) was
 ‘ Better not touch me!’ He is, in
 fact, setting up here the ﬁgure of
 himself which his earlier critics had
 constructed, exaggerating it and
 making it ridiculous by a burlesque
 defence, in the conﬁdent assurance
 that his real purpose in satire
 was by this time fully recognized.

 46. cantabitur: ιζι. the whole
 town shall be repeating the satiri-

 47—56. These lines serve a
 double purpose. As a part of
 the ironical argument they pre·
 tend to justify the determination
 (44—46) to continue the writing of
 satire (‘Canidia poisons her ene-
 mies and I will poison mine: the
 wolf bites and therefore I will
 write biting satire‘), and they
 illustrate the general principle
 (vss. 24—28) that men are not to
 be blamed for yielding to their
 special weaknesses (‘and satire is
 my weakness,’ vs. 28). At the
 same time, these allusions, which
 a reader of Horace’s time would
 at once understand, show how
 harmless and impersonal his
 satire really was. For no one
 of the ﬁve persons named was
 really an enemy of Horace. Cer-
 vius, Albucius, and Scaeva are
 names which occur ’elsewhere
 (Sat. 2, 6, 77; 2, 2,67; Epist. 1,
 17, 1)⁷ but with quite different
 characteristics; they are merely
 Roman names which do not refer
 to individuals. Canidia is fre-

 There is no internal evidence to ﬁx the date of this satire; it was
 written between 35 and 30 ac.

 ‘The advantages of plain living—I am repeating what I once heard
 from a wise old farmer— cannot be properly set forth in an after-dinner
 conversation; only a hungry man can know how good plain food may
 be. At a dinner party your judgment is confused by the elaborate
 cookery and—still. worse—by the rarity or the novelty of the viands.
 Indeed, the very over-abundance sometimes drives you back in disgust
 to simple ﬂavors. For it is only lately that you have learned, in obedi-
 ence to ﬁshion, to like stork; roast sea-gull will be the next whim, I
 suppose.

 ‘But you must not think—says my old farmer—that simplicity
 means stinginess. Do not rush to the other extreme; keep to the
 middle course of a plain neatness.

 ‘ Consider, now, the advantages of such a way of living : health, vigor,
 the pleasure of occasional indulgence, hospitality, good repute, money
 left in your purse, and, chief of all, readiness to meet the buffets of for-
 tune. I used to hear the old farmer, then a hired laborer on the farm
 he had once owned, discoursing about this to his sons: “ I have lived
 a temperate life and my wants are few. Let Fortune do her worst; he
 that is down need fear no fall.“

 In form, this satire, like 3, 4, 7, 8 of this book, consists of a main
 body of didactic discourse set in an introductory framework. In the

 ISS

 f,

 2, 2, 1] HORATI
 other satires, however, the framework is in dialogue, generally very
 skilfully adapted to its special purpose, while here the setting is not
 clearly conceived (cf. vs. 7 note), the introduction is too brief (vss. 2 f.) ,
 and the quotation passes from indirect to direct without suﬂicient mo-
 tive and with a second and superﬂuous introduction (vss. 112-115).
 In the main discourse also there is a similar lack of clearness of outline.
 The change from the plural (vss. 1-7) to the vague tu breaks the con-
 tinuity. The reference to Ofellus in vs. 53 is not distinct enough to
 preserve the illusion of quotation. The knowledge of places, fashions,
 and persons in Rome is quite inconsistent with the circumstances of an
 Apulian peasant; this is in part to be explained by the fact that the
 whole satire is a parody of a Stoic sermon, in which allusions to Roman
 affairs would be quite in place, but the inconsistency remains and adds
 nothing to the humor. The explanation of these incongruities in struc-
 ture is that Horace is here experimenting with a form of satire which is
 a compromise between the dialogue form of Satires 3, 4„ 7, and 8 and the
 frankly personal monologue of Satire 6, and is inferior to either.

 There is a similar compromise or combination in the subject-matter;
 on the one hand, the satire contrasts country life with the life of the
 city, as is done in greater fulness and with greater effectiveness in
 Satire 6; on the other hand, the luxuries and fashions of the table,
 which are ridiculed here, are treated more fully and more humorously in
 Satires 4 and 8. But the two subjects harmonize more easily than
 the two forms. The combination, however, is marked enough to sug-
 gest the hypothesis that this satire is the earliest of the book in date of
 composition, and that both form and subject were worked out to greater
 perfection in the later satires.

 Quae virtus et quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo
 (nec meus hic sermo est, sed quae praecepit Ofellus
 rusticus, abnormis sapiens, crassaque Minerva),

 1. boni: ὦγαθοί, as a friendly
 form of address.

 2. nec meus . . . eat: the same
 phrase, κούκ ἐμὸς ὁ μῦθος, occurs
 in a fragment of Euripides and is
 quoted by Plato, Symp. 177 A.

 3. abnormis: unsclzooled, not
 bound by the doctrines of any

 sect. So Cicero, de Amic. 5, 18,
 says that certain Roman worthies
 were not philosophers, ad istorum
 normam-crassa Minerva: of a
 rough-and-rcady wit. Cf. pingui
 [When/a, Cic. de Amic. 5, 19.
 Minerva is the goddess of intelli—
 gence.

 two words seem to suggest a par-
 ticular scene and certain deﬁnite
 circumstances — a group of friends

 constructed sentence is simple;
 ‘get an appetite by hard exercise,
 and then see whether you are dis-

 after mentioning two kinds of
 Roman exercise, hunting (cf. Epod.
 2, 29 ﬂ'.; Carm. 1, ι, 25 ﬂ'.) and
 riding (Carm. 3, 8, 5 5.), he intro-
 duces as an alternative two kinds
 of Greek athletics, ball-playing and
 the throwing of the dircus, each
 in a conditional clause, seu pila
 (te agit), seu discus te agil,- the
 ﬁrst is left without a formal apod-
 osis, but pete is the apodosis to
 the second. Then as the formal
 structure of the sentence has been
 disturbed, the substance of 9-13 is
 condensed into cum . . . extuderit

 168·

  

 SERMONES [2. 3

 (vs. 5) ﬁxes the time of year when the dialogue is supposed to take
 place, but indicates nothing in regard to the time when it was composed.

 In structure this is the most carefully arranged of all the satires. The
 main body is a sermon by the philosopher Stertinius (alluded to in Eptkt.
 3, 12, 20, but otherwise unknown to us) upon the Stoic Paradox πᾶς
 ἄφρων μαίνεται, that all men except the Stoic philosopher are mad.
 The discourse is carefully divided into four parts, taking up in turn the
 avaricious (82—157), the ambitious (158-223), the self-indulgent (224-
 246, with a special subdivision, 247—280, for the amorous), and the super-
 stitious (281—295). There is a brief introduction (77-81) and a
 corresponding conclusion (296—299). This discourse is repeated to
 Horace by Damasippus, a recent convert to Stoicism, whose character
 and circumstances are admirably adapted to his part. He had been a
 collector of antique bronzes and a dealer in real estate and is alluded
 to by Cicero (ad Fam. 7, 23, 2; ad Alt. 12, 29, 2; 12, 33, 3) in connec-
 tion with the purchase of statuary and of land for gardens. But he had
 afterward failed in business and in his despair was about to throw him-
 self into the Tiber, when he was saved by the intervention of Stertinius.
 The logical reasoning by which Stertinius convinced him that his mo-
 tive for suicide was insufﬁcient is an excellent bit of philosophical fool-
 ing and serves as an introduction to the main sermon.

 The circumstances which brought Damasippus into contact with
 Horace are disclosed in a brief introductory dialogue (1-31). Horace
 represents himself as having gone out to his quiet Sabine farm at the
 time of the Saturnalia to escape the Christmas festivities and to do some
 work. But the work had been postponed and he was sitting in his
 study dozing after a good dinner (vini somnique benignus), when
 Damasippus burst in upon him, uninvited, having come out from the
 city full of zeal to rouse him from his laziness.‘ To his exhortations
 Horace replies with good-natured irony in a rather superior tone and
 ﬁnally submits to a recital of the long sermon. When it is over (300—
 326), he rouses himself to make further ironical remarks, to which
 Damasippus replies with such point that Horace for a moment loses his
 temper and then surrenders, acknowledging himself to be as great a
 madman—almost—as his visitor. The opening and the closing bits
 of dialogue thus form a framework for the main body of the satire.

 To the carefulness in construction an equal care in expression has
 been added. There are few passages where the thought is not clearly
 expressed and there are many of special excellence, like the farcical
 scene from the camp before Troy (187-207), a forerunner of Sat. 2, 5,
 or the brilliant paraphrase of the ﬁrst lines of the Eunuchus (262-271).

 169

  

 2, 3, 1] HORATI

 The synonyms for insanus collected by Teuffel (furiosus, excors, delirus,
 amens, amentia versatus, demens, cerritus, commotus, commotae mentis,
 mentem concussus, male lutae mentis, putidi cerebri) are evidence of the
 pains taken to avoid monotony.

 As to the underlying motive of the satire, it seems probable that the
 accusations of idleness in the opening lines were not without founda-
 tion. After the publication of the First Book there was probably a
 period in which Horace was disinclined to go on with precisely the
 same kind of writing and was perhaps turning toward lyric poetry.
 During this time of hesitation he may well have seemed to be occupied
 with his farm (307 f.) and to have abandoned his literary ambitions.
 To the doubts of his friends and the criticisms of his enemies this long
 and carefully constructed satire was intended to be a reply. At the
 same time it is, even more distinctly than Sal. 2, 2, an attempt to touch
 the follies of mankind with a lighter touch. The burlesque of Stoic
 formalism and solemnity runs through the whole and is in many places
 worked out in detail, so that the satire might well be taken to be a satire
 upon that sect. On the other hand, however, the absurdities and follies
 which are the subject-matter are equally the objects of attack, but they
 are made ridiculous by exaggeration rather than reproved. If the ﬁrst
 part of the sermon of Stertinius (vss. 82-157) be compared with Sat. 1, 1,
 which deals with the same subject, the difference in manner will be
 apparent. There is in this satire none of the direct argument which
 gives a serious tone to Sat. 1, I ς the sermon of Stertinius is a series of
 absurd illustrations,-— Staberius, Aristippus, the senseless miser, Orestes,
 Opimius,- which ridicule avarice by presenting it in its extremest forms.
 In short, the genial raillery of Horace is here directed by turns upon
 the preacher, upon the congregation, and upon the satirist himself.

 to forestall his excuses: ‘There
 is no use in blaming the pens

 doesn’t deserve to bear the re-

 The expression would then be like

 the phrase ‘in Wall Street.’—ali-

 frenzy.

 a mistake ,· the common phrase
 is ne sis frustra-insanis . . .

 dox which forms the text of the

 33. crepat: prutes. The word
 is contemptuous, and inconsistent
 with 296, sapientium octavus, as
 with the general attitude of Dama-
 sippus. It is another slip on
 Horace’s part, like 39 and 28.—
 unde: a quo.

 35. sapientem pucere barbam:

 double humor of the whole satire ;
 they analyze the universal folly of
 men and at the same time they
 exhibit the folly of the Stoic him-
 self, who addresses an elaborate
 argument to a man about to com-
 mit suicide and, in particular, an
 argument which does not prove
 the hearer sane, but only no more
 insane than his fellow-men.

 43. Primum: in proper Stoic
 style, the argument begins with a
 deﬁnition. -fureret a synonym
 for insanum esse.

 not forbid suicide and Stertinius
 treats the question as one of pure

 moved by blind and ignorant im-
 pulse, instead of being guided by
 wisdom’ (the opposite of stulti·

 founder of the school, which took
 its name from the στοά, the Porch,
 where he taught. Chrysippus was
 the greatest of Zeno’s successors
 and was often spoken of as the

 the mother should reply age,
 adsta, mane, audi. But, on one
 occasion, an actor named F uﬁus,
 who was playing the part of Iliona,
 had been drinking (ebrius) and

 actually fell asleep, so that the

 appeal of the son (played by
 Catienus) did not waken him, and
 the audience, seeing the situation,
 joined in repeating the ﬁrst words
 mater, te appello. -Ilionam edor-
 mit: a cognate acc., like Cyclopa
 saltare (Sat. 1, 5, 63), but with a
 humorous effect; was sleeping tlte
 part of Iliona. -mille ducentis:
 twice the usual round number,
 sescenti.

 62 f. Huic . . . errori= refers
 backrto 49 and 51; the error is
 inscitia veri (43), the failurevto
 see things as they really are.—
 eimilemz sc. errorem, which
 would be a cognate acc. after
 tnsantre.

 65. integer mantis: = sanus.-
 eeto= i.e. ‘ grant it.for the moment
 and then see what absurdities it
 leads to.’ The argument is that if
 Damasippus had proved himself a
 madman, as his creditors declared,
 by losing money in speculation,
 then the creditors had still more
 proved themselves madmen by

 HOR. SAT. — I2

 loaning him the money that he
 had lost. The error was the same,
 though the manifestations of it
 were different.

 67 f. excors = = insanus. - prae.
 eene Mercurium a creditor who
 offered money with the full under-
 standing that it was never to be
 repaid would be to the debtor like
 the very god of riches in per-
 son.

 67—71. These words are ad·
 dressed to the lender of the money
 and the genera] sense is plain:
 ‘take all the precautions you can,
 ten notes or, if ten are not enough,
 a hundred, a thousand; yet you
 must certainly know that your
 debtor can slip through them all, as
 Proteus slips through all bonds.’
 N erius is the banker who pays over
 the money on an order ’from the
 creditor. With decem some gen-
 eral word like scrzpta was in
 Horace’s mind, but the sentence
 is interrupted by the hasty words
 mm est satis and when the thought
 is resumed, tabulas takes the place
 of the object; ten copies of the
 entry or order are not enough.
 Cicuta is a money-lender (referred
 to only here and in vs. 175) who
 is especially skilful in drawing up

 legally binding forms of obliga- si uation there is highly tragic and

 the same ﬁgure. The creditor is
 not named here, though, as the
 thought becomes more deﬁnite
 (cf. Sat. 1, 1, 15, and 20),he is
 called Perellius. Proteus is the
 sea-god who prophesies only when
 he is caught and held and who
 changes himself into many forms
 (vs. 73) to escape his captor.
 [The diHiculty of this passage
 centers in scribe decem a Nerio,
 and it is the desire to make the
 sense of the whole passage square
 with our really insuﬁ‘icient knowl-
 edge of the technical terms and
 the method of procedure that has
 led Bentley and Kiessling into
 forced interpretations.]

 72. malis ridentem alienisz a
 parody of the Homeric οἶ δ’
 γναθμοῖσι γελώων ἀλλοτρίοισιν
 (Od. 20, 347). But the phrase,
 which is perhaps proverbial, oc-
 curs only once in Homer, and the

 dramatic; the suitors laughedbe-

 ,cause Athene had taken away their

 judgment, but woe was in their
 hearts. Some such sense as un-
 natural, hysterical laughter would
 perhaps ﬁt both passages, but it is
 possible that Horace merely trans-
 lated the phrase literally, with-
 out attaching a deﬁnite meaning
 to it.

 77—81. The introduction to the
 formal sermon. Both in the elab-

 it is a parody of Stoic teaching.
 It is addressed to other hearers
 than Damasippus, but it is not
 necessary to suppose that Horace

 still standing on the pons Fabri-

 attributes the sins of the individual
 (a malefactor of great wealth) to

 friend and the sister who had
 helped him to carry out his pur-
 pose. The passage in which he
 calls his sister a Fury is in Eurip-
 ides, Orest. 264, but there is no
 place in an extant play in which
 he uses hard words of Pylades.
 The whole reference in 140 f. has
 nothing to do with the argument;
 it may be introduced as a bit of
 Stoic precision in triﬂes or it may

 be mere burlesque of a tragic sit-

 of madness and splendida is ap-
 parently used literally, shining,

 conclusion, and to go on without
 preface to a new illustration. Cf.,

 mus, as Novius, in Sat. r, 6, 40,
 from novus, and contrasted with
 pauper.-argenti= gen. with
 pauper.

 208 f. The terms here used are
 colored with Stoic meanings.
 Species are the impressions re-
 ceived through the senses; if they
 do not correspond to the reality
 (alias veris), that fact is evidence

 of illusion, as in~vss. 53—58. If
 they are still further distorted by
 passion (tumultu pernaidas), the
 evidence of insanity is complete
 (commotus habebitur). The sense
 of scelus also is technical, for the
 Stoic refused to distinguish crime
 from madness (cf. vss. 278 5.);
 sceleris tumultu is hardly more
 than insano tumultu. ,

 had actually occurred in this bare
 form. For Horace does not mean
 that such a gathering as this took

 the burlesque of the Stoic manner

 was that crime and madness were

 The date of this satire cannot be ﬁxed, but its character is such that
 the precise date is of no importance. It was probably written after
 Sat. 2, 2.

 In form it is, like the preceding satire, a main body of discourse
 enclosed in a framework of dialogue. Horace meets upon the street
 an acquaintance who is hurrying home to commit to writing certain
 precepts of gastronomy which he had just heard. At Horace’s request
 he consents to repeat them and after he has done so, in the main body
 of the satire (vss. 12—87), Horace, deeply impressed, begs that he may
 himself be allowed to attend the next lecture on the important subject
 and hear with his own ears. The introductory dialogue and the con-
 cluding request are less dramatic than the corresponding parts of the
 preceding satire, but they contrast in a somewhat similar way the
 enthusiasm of the believer with .the attitude of Horace and they are
 admirable specimens of ironical deference.

 The main discourse consists of a series of precepts for the selection
 and serving of the courses of a dinner. They follow in general the
 order of the Roman dinner, the gustatio, the main course, wines and
 sauces, and the dessert, with advice about the service of the table.
 Each precept is given separately, as if it were an oracle which needs no
 explanation or logical connection. The style is serious and almost
 epic,as beﬁts the seriousness of the speaker, but there is no such
 parody of the manner of the philosopher as in Satires 2 and 3. The
 irony which is easily felt in the dialogue is here less apparent, especially
 to .the modern reader, to whom many of the details of Roman cookery
 must remain unknown. The reader of Horace's time, however, would
 feel at once the absurdity of the precepts, both in general and in details,
 and would therefore be conscious of the humor of lines which to the
 modern reader are rather dull.

 The speaker is called Catius and he is represented (vs. r I) as quoting
 from the discourse of an authority on gastronomy whose name he avoids
 giving. This is, in form, the same device that is used in Sat. z, 3, where
 Damasippus quotes from Stertinius, and in Sat. 2, 7, in which the slave

 201

 2, 4, 3] HORATI
 repeats the teachings which he had learned from the door-keeper of
 Crispinus (vs. 45). Such machinery of the satirical form is not to be
 taken seriously; in Sat. 2, 7 it is plainly a mere joke and the Damasip-
 pus-Stertinius relation in Sat. 2, 3 serves only to give a background for
 the parody of Stoic preaching. Of the various identiﬁcations of Catius
 the only one which has both plausibility and point is the one proposed
 by Manso and revived by Palmer, that the name is a disguise of Matius,
 the friend of Cicero, Caesar, Trebatius and Augustus. But, in tact, the
 precise identiﬁcation of either Catius or the mysterious auctor is of no
 more importance than the precise determination of the date of composi-
 tion. The satire contains in itself its own best commentary. It is a
 bit of humorous and not unfriendly irony, directed primarily against
 some person whose name is ostentatiously withheld and, more broadly,
 against the science and art of gastronomy. So far as there is any per-
 sonality in it, it is of a kind which would be especially understood and
 appreciated by Horace’s intimate friends, and the satire belongs, in this
 respect, to the same class as Sat. 1, 9 and Sat. 2, 8. In all three there
 is the note of intimacy and it is not at all impossible that the learning
 of this satire is a parody of gastronomic conversations which Horace
 had heard at the table of Maecenas.

 The date of this satire is ﬁxed by vss. 62 ff. The phrase tellure
 marique magnus would not have been used in the years just before
 Actium, when it was increasingly apparent that the supremacy by sea
 was still to be decided. After Actium there was a general expectation
 that Octavius would carry out the project of his uncle for a war of con-
 quest in the East and it is to such expectations that Part/u} horrendus
 refers. The satire was written soon after the battle of Aetium, late in
 31 or early in 30.

 The subject-matter is the practice of seeking legacies. To treat this
 as a profession, however, is to take satire too seriously; it was a social
 evil, like free divorce or political bribery, which the satin'st ridicules by
 assuming an ironical seriousness. The.custom of leaving legacies, often
 small, but not infrequently of substantial amount, to many friends was
 already common in the Ciceronian period. It was to be expected that
 the custom would lead to the cultivation of friendships in the hope of a
 legacy and the tendency was strengthened by the large increase of
 wealth in the hands of men who did not know how to use it. Such
 men, often of the freedman class, sometimes without family connections,
 would be especially open to the ﬂattering approaches of persons of
 higher position.

 The satire is a continuation, in burlesque, of a scene in the Odyssey,
 11, 90 if. The shade of the Theban seer, Tiresias, meets Odyssem in
 the lower world and at his request tells him how he may secure his
 return to Ithaca and how he may summon the shade of his mother.
 After this interview the seer returns (vs. I 50 f.) to the home of Hades.
 At this point Horace interjects the conversation which forms this satire.
 The selection of the venerable prophet of Thebes ,to give advice such
 as this is as happy as the selection of Trebatius in Sat. 2, l, and Odys-

 seus, with the mingling of the crafty and the heroic in his traditional
 character, is admirably suited to receive the doctrine.

 Travesty of heroic legends had a considerable place in Greek litera-
 ture, especially in comedy; Plautus has one example in the Amphitruo
 and Varro’had used it in his Saturae [nemppeae. It has been fre-
 quently used in modern literature; Thackeray’s Rebecca and Rowena
 and Mark Twain’s A Yankee in King Arthur’s Court are familiar ex-
 amples. Horace hm combined the humor of travesty with the humor
 of pretended seriousness in the treatment of his subject-matter, like the
 seriousness of De Quincey in Murder as a Fine Art.

 the noun is so frequently omitted
 that in late Latin limis was mis-
 taken for a nom. sing.; with a
 side glauce. -prima . . . cera:
 the will was written on wax tab-
 lets with raised edges, which could
 be tied together and sealed. On
 the inside of the ﬁrst leaf the name
 of the testator was written in the
 first line and thername of the heir
 in the second (secundo versu).
 The fixed position of the names
 made it easy to read them at a
 glance—quid . . . velit: what
 ﬂuﬁrxt page says,· the sense is

 . cumqne: cf.

 different when sibi is added, as in
 VS.5652}. This instance of the un-
 happy result of a neglect of the
 precautions just mentioned is put
 in the form of a reference to an

 event of Horace‘s time, which the
 seer relates as a prophecy (deludet,
 dabit) and in the ambiguous lan-
 guage of an oracle. Of course
 all the Roman words and names
 (scriba, quinquevir, Nasica, Cora-
 nus) are unintelligible to Ulysses,
 and the fable of the Fox and the

 -Raven was unknown to him.—

 recoctus: boiled over, with a ref-
 erence to the Medea legend.—
 qninqneviro: a subordinate police
 oﬁicial— Coranus- who had risen
 to the unimportant ofﬁce of scriba.
 The details incrmse the perplexity
 of Ulysses and help to make the
 whole incident ridiculous.

 ' 59 f. aut erit aut non: as Tire-
 sias is supposed to mean it, this
 would be ‘ what I say will happen,
 will, and what I say will not hap-
 pen, will not,’ but the possible
 double meaning makes it a bur-
 lesque of the solemn claims of
 sooth-sayers. The verse is quoted
 by Boethius (de Cous. 5, 3) as
 vaticinium illud ridiculum Tire-
 siae. The absurdity is heightened

 thets (cf. Sat. 2, 3, 2‘16) used in
 derision in this case, where the
 inducement to the marriage was

 neither courage nor beauty, but „U

 the payment of a debt. \

 metuo is frequently weakened, es-

 meanings like hesitate, be unwill-
 ing,- cf. Carm. 2, 2, 7, penna
 metuente solvi. - soldmn: the syn-
 copated colloquial form for soli-
 dum, the prinapal of the debt.
 The point is that as Nasica was
 unwilling to pay a debt (presum-
 ably to Coranus), he gave Coranus
 his daughter instead, hoping that
 the son-in-law would leave to him
 or to his daughter a sum which
 would more than counterbalance
 the debt. The relative age of
 father-in-law and son-in-law is left
 out of account, or the case is like
 the marriage of Pompey to Caesar’s
 daughter.

 This satire was written at about the same time as the preceding
 (2, 5), late in 31 B.C. or early in 30. The ‘chilling rumor about the
 Dacians ’ (vss. 50, 53) refers to the popular fear of an invasion of Italy
 by the. Daci after the battle of Actium, and the uncertainty in regard to
 the allotment of land to the veterans (vss. 55 f.) was terminated by the
 brief visit of Octavius to Brundisium early in 30. Other indications
 (38) point to the same date.

 The connection of thought is simple: ‘I now have in my Sabine
 farm more than I had dared to hope for, and my only desire is that my
 present happiness may continue without change. No better subject
 than this could offer itself to my humble Muse, as I begin the day here.
 For at Rome the day begins quite differently, with one engagement
 after another, and even though a visit to Maecenas may be one of them,

 219

 mula of farewell, viw valeque, is
 also used with humorous effect.

 2, 6] - HORATI

 yet the pleasure is half spoiled by the requests of my acquaintances
 that I should use my inﬂuence with Maecenas on their behalf. They

 _ do not understand that my friendship with him has nothing to do with
 public affairs; in fact, we never speak of such things, and I am glad to
 escape from it all and get back into the country, and to hear the simple
 talk of my good neighbors, like Cervius’ story of the Town Mouse and
 the Country Mouse.’

 This satire is a partial return to the forms used in the First Book.
 The main body of the discourse (vss. 77-117) is, it is true, formally
 separated from the rest and put into the mouth of another speaker; in
 so far Horace uses the newer form with which he had been experiment—
 ing in Sat. z, a; 2, 3. The main body, however, is not enclosed in a
 framework of formal dialogue, but is introduced by an expression of
 personal opinion and feeling, like that with which Sat. 1, 6 concludes.
 It was, undoubtedly, the strength of personal feeling to be expressed

 ’ that led Horace to return to his earlier method of treatment instead of

 using the form of Sat. 2, 2 and 2, 3, which is better suited to burlesque
 and persijlagt than to serious discussion.

 In general tone, also, this satire — which has in it little of the satirical
 element—is a return to the manner of the First Book. It is not, how-
 ever, a mere turning back. The intervening years had left their health-
 ful mark upon Horace, and in his personal attitude he shows the good
 effect that success in honest endeavor has upon all men of large nature;
 he is not less modest, perhaps he is more modest (vss. 40—58), but he
 no longer needs to explain himself or to defend his conduct. The sense
 of easy security centered about his closest friend, Maecenas, and about
 the farm which was the gift of that friend, and he felt the impulse to
 express his contentment. It is to be remembered, also, that Horace
 was, as Kiessling reminds us, a ‘country boy.’ It was in Rome that
 he had done his work, and there he had made himself a place, but his
 profoundest interest was not in the life of clubs and dinners. He never
 ceased to feel the desire for the quieter life of the country, as this satire
 and Epod. 2 sufﬁciently testify.

 Meanwhile, a change had come over public affairs, not unlike the
 change in his own circumstances. The rule of Octavius had justiﬁed
 itself, so far as such rule can ever be justiﬁed, and the security which
 Horace had received from Maecenas, Rome had had as a gift from Mae-
 cenas* chief. Between Octavius and Antony no sane man could hesi-
 tate, and beneath the personal contentment which this satire expresses
 it is easy to hear the note of political repose and contentment which
 followed the decision at Actium. This satire was not written by the

 also to the scene that lay before

 2. iugis: in form either gen.
 or nom., but the balance —— vicinus
 -jfons, iugis-aquae-requires a
 genitive.

 3. super his: the acc. is more
 common, but the abl. is freely used
 by Horace (super foco, Carm. r,
 9, 5; super Pindo, Carm. 1, 12,
 6). His usage favors the local
 meaning above these (not in addi-
 tion to these things), i.e. on the
 overhanging ridge of the hill. This
 little wood-land is referred to also
 in Carm. 3, 16, 29 f., silva iugerum
 paucorum and in Epist. I, 14, 1,
 and there is a fuller description in
 Epish r, 16, 5 ﬂ'. —Auctina: more
 liberally.

 5. Kain natet cf. Vergil’s
 nate dea. Mercury, as the god of
 gain (eg. Sat. 2, 3, 25), was the
 god to whom the prayer for am-
 plius would be addressed—hue

 than hoc, vs. 1, a reference to the
 scene before him.—faxie: the
 archaic form (fac-s-is, a sigmatic
 aorist optative), still used in pray-
 ers and curses.

 6 f. Cf. the advice of the
 father to his two sons, Sat. 2, 3,
 177 f., and the note there. The
 thought here is the same, but it is
 expressed somewhat elliptically
 and with a careful contmt of
 phrasing which covers up the
 thought. The real emphasis is
 upon Horace’s contentment with
 what he has and his determination
 to avoid in the future, as he has
 in the past, either of the extremes
 against which so much of *his -
 preaching is directed, either the
 extreme of money-loving or the
 opposite extreme of wastefulness.
 There is no contrast between
 ratione mala and some ratio bona
 nor between vitio culpave and
 some creditable way of lessening
 one’s property, eg. by charity;
 the contrast is between the avarus
 with his usual ratio mala and the
 nepos with his vitium culpave.

 with mercatus. The whole should

 treasure and with it bought and
 cultivated the very farm on which
 he had been before a hired laborer.’

 :3. Hercule: there are a few
 references, not perfectly clear, to
 Hercules w the god of, hidden
 treasures, but the explanation of
 the reference to him here is to be
 found in the folk-story that Horace
 is alluding to, which is given by
 Porphyrio : ‘ traditur fabula, fuisse
 quendam mercennarium qui sem-

 already done.

 χε t. ambitio: something of

 here the reference is to the social
 struggle (23 iil), rather than to
 the political. —plumbeus: the
 Sirocco, Auster, brings a peculiar
 sense of oppression, like a weight.
 - Libitinae quaestus : at thetemple
 of Venus Libitina funerals were
 registered and fees paid, and the
 things necessary for a funeral
 were obtained by undertakers.
 A season of ill-health, like the
 autumn (Epiri. 1, 7, 1-9), was
 therefore a time of gain (quaes-
 tus) for the goddess.

 aoﬁ. As the references to the
 farm, especially vss. 16 f., are
 meant to indicate the place where
 this satire-was written, so these
 lines are meant to indicate the
 time of day, the early morning.

 day in his place of refuge suggests
 to Horace both the invocation to

 entations over the so-called so-
 cial duties which waste the time
 in Rome are quite in the vein of
 Sat. 1, 9. He is struggling be-
 tween a sense of what courtesy
 demands and an impatient desire
 to be rid of the annoyances. It is
 annoying to have to go to court
 on a cold day, but it would be
 still more annoying to feel that

 he had failed to meet the claims
 of friendship; it is highly un-
 pleasant to him to push his way
 through the crowd and give just
 cause for remonstrance, and his
 consciousness of being in the

 bear the impudent remonstrance
 of the man whom he has jostled.

 was a stone curbing around a spot
 in the Forum where lightning had

 not far from it.

 36 f. These lines afford an in-
 teresting little glimpse into the
 professional relations of Horace
 as a member still of the ordo of
 minor government ofﬁcials, the
 scribae. It is, in effect, a notice
 of a meeting of the organization
 (‘important business’), given
 orally to Horace, who is ad-
 dressed familiarly by his ‘ﬁrst’
 name.-—orabant meminissent par-

 initials on a paper. As it is known
 that, during the months within
 which the composition of this satire
 must fall, Maecenas was the repre-
 sentative of Octavius in Rome and
 had authority to use his seal, the
 document was probably one that
 had to do with public business.

 39. Dixeris: as if putting the

 is apparently intended to suggest
 increasingly deﬁnite reminiscence:

 of the introduction, see Sat. I, 6,
 54H. The expression hese is al-
 most the same as the one used
 there, iubes esse in amicorum nu-
 mero, with the evident intention
 of recalling that satire, as the next
 words recall the journey to Brundi-
 sium, Sat. ι, 5. The earlier claims
 to friendship are here qualiﬁed, to
 guard against the interpretations
 which had been put upon them.
 The friendship has nothing to do
 with public affairs.

 It enforces in general terms the
 lesson of Horace’s own preference,
 and it is at the same time an
 anilis fabella, at which one smiles
 while he recognizes its underlying
 truth. The actors are Lilliputian,
 but their action embodies a large
 truth. This double purpose is re—
 ﬂected in the style, which has a
 kind of old-fashioned formality.
 The tone is carefully set in the
 elaborate structure of the ﬁrst sen-
 tence; the four words rusticus . . .

 -—adj.—adj., noun—noun ; nom—acc.,

 ace-nom ; rusticus-urbanum, mu-

 The precise date of this satire mnnot be ﬁxed. The allusion in vs.
 23 may be either to Sat. 2, 2 or to the second half of Sat. 2, 6, and vs.
 28, Romae rus optas, may also refer to Sat. 2, 6, 59 ff. These indica-
 tions point in a general way to a late date.

 The form is the characteristic form of this book, which is used also
 in Satires 3, 4, and 8. The main body of the satire is a discourse
 addressed to Horace himself, which is introduced and then brought to
 a close by bits of dialogue suited to the subject and to speaker and
 listener. The resemblance to the third satire is particularly close;
 both are on the feast of the Saturnalia, in both Horace is interrupted
 by the intrusion of the speaker and in turn interrupts the speaker before
 the main discourse is reached (3, 26 and 31; 7, 21 ᾗ), and both close
 with an outbreak of anger on Horace’s part.

 In substance also this satire is much like the third. That is a dis-
 course upon the Stoic Paradox that all men except the philosopher are
 insane; this has for its text the other Paradox that all men but the
 philosopher are slaves, ὅτι. μόνος ὁ σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος, καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων
 δοῦλος. This is the subject of Cicero⁷s Parad. V. and Horace follows
 in part the same line of reasoning, using in vss. 89 ﬂ'. the illustration
 of the lover enslaved by a woman and in vss. 95 ff. the illustration of
 the infatuated admirer of works of art, almost precisely as they are
 used by Cicero. As in the third satire the preacher upon the insanity
 of men is the half-crazy Damasippus, so here the person who discourses
 upon the slavery of men is Horace’s own slave, Davus, and as Dama-
 sippus ’gets his wisdom from Stertinius (and Catius, in the fourth satire,
 from an unnamed auctor), so in this satire, with a clever parody, Davus
 has learned his philosophy from the door-keeper of the philosopher
 Crispinus. The form of Stoic discourse is less distinctly parodied than
 in Sat. 3, perhaps only in vs. 83, and it is evident that Horace was less
 inclined to burlesque this Paradox than he had been to ﬂout the doc-
 trine that all men are insane. The truth that men are the slaves of
 their follies and vices is so familiar to us, that we are, in fact, obliged

 234

 SERMONES [2, 7, 6
 to remind ourselves that slavery was an ever-present reality in the Roman
 world, in order to understand how the doctrine could have been called
 a paradox at all. This satire is, therefore, even more than the: third,
 and more, indeed, than any other in the Second Book, a direct attack
 upon the follies of mankind. But the sharpness which shows itself in

 - some of the satires of the First Book is entirely avoided by the humorous

 expedient of representing the satire as directed against Horace himself,
 as in the close of the third. That Horace is not drawing a picture of
 himself, however, is plain from such passages as vs. 53, vss. 89 ῆῖ, 102
 ΕΣ, no f. ; the faults there attacked are not those to which Horace was

 prone. But there is enough caricature of himself (vss. 23 ff., 29 ff.) to
 add a pleasant humor to the whole. It must be said also that there is
 some return to the intentional coarseness of Sat. 1, 2.

 with his boldness later.

 Nothing in this satire ﬁxes the date of composition. It can only
 be said that it was written between 35 and 30 B.C., and that in subject
 and general treatment it is like the other satires of this book.

 In form it most closely resembles Sat. 2, 4; the main part of it is
 an account of certain sayings and doings related by another person to
 Horace at his request, with a brief introductory dialogue. The sub-
 ject-matter connects it both with Sat. 2, 2, as a contrast to simple
 living, and with 2, 4, as a satire in a different vein upon the serious-
 minded epicure.

 The main body of it is a description of a dinner, given in much
 detail. The names of the guests are mentioned and their places at the
 table and there are elaborate descriptions of the food and cookery.
 After the dinner had advanced a little and the host had shown a dis-
 position to brag of his food and wines, some of the guests proposed
 heavy drinking. The host turned their attention again to the food, but
 while he was describing one of the dishes, a canopy over the table fell
 and covered the whole company with dust. The host at this mishap
 burst into tears and was with difﬁculty induced by the encouragements
 of some of his guests, which he did not perceive to be ironical, to pro-
 ceed with the feast. When he did go on, he continued to talk so much
 about the food, that the guests, in revenge, declined to eat it. The
 satire ends abruptly, without the concluding dialogue or comment which
 is generally found in the satires of this book.

 This is not a description of some actual dinner at the house of an
 individual who might be identiﬁed. All attempts to connect the host,
 Nasidienus Rufus, with some person known to us,—for example, with
 salvidienus Rufus, -fail in details and are mistaken in their purpose.
 It is quite inconceivable that Horace should have made public the
 story of such a dinner, at which Maecenas and Varius were guests,
 and should have represented a well-known man like Fundanius as
 guilty of the extreme discourtesy of ridiculing the host whose invita-
 tion he had accepted. To readers of Horace’s time the mere fact that
 the story is told by Fundanius, the writer of humorous plays, would at
 once have given the dew to the burlesque character of the whole. It
 is no more to be taken as serious narrative than the legal consultation
 in Sat. 2, 1, the discourse of Ofellus in 2, 2, the sermon of Damasippus
 in 2, 3, or in fact any satire of this book except the earlier half of the
 sixth.

 243

 2, s, 1] HORATI

 But though the setting and the details are pure burlesque, there is
 a certain amount of serious purpose underneath, as in Sat. 2, 3, for
 example, where the Stoic is burlesqued, but the follies of mankind are
 also satirized. The host at the banquet, who is here ridiculed on his
 lighter side, is a type of the same man who is attacked with savage
 directness in Epod. 4, the man of low station and no culture, whose
 suddenly acquired wealth has not changed his nature. He is repre-
 sented here as an aspiring epicure, proud of his knowledge of the art
 of cookery and seeking to advance his acquaintance with Maecenas by
 giving him a particularly ﬁne dinner. But the ridicule is directed quite
 as much, perhaps even more, against the absurd solemnities of the
 epicure. There are passages (vss. 6 5., 43 ff., especially 85 if.) which
 are indistinguishable in tone and manner from parts of Sat. 2, 4, and
 which have no point at all unless we understand them as we do that
 satire, -—as ironical parodies of the precepts of fine cookery.

 This is not one of the best of the satires. The humor is not always
 in good taste; there is too close an approach to horse-play and, though
 Maecenas and the literary men are kept in the background, with the
 evident purpose of guarding their dignity, the rest of the guests are not
 superior in good-breeding to the host whom they ridicule. The scene
 is, with some differences, not unlike the supper described in Sat. 1, 5,
 51 ἦ. and, in general, this satire has many of the characteristics, both
 positive and negative, of Sat. 1, 5. The explanation is that Horace is
 here also, as in 1, 5, following a satire of Lucilius (Charis. in Gr. Lat.
 p. 100 K., Lucilius . . . deridens rusticam (mam; the fragments are
 in Marx, 193 ff.), doubtless improving upon the form, but hampered by
 his model. The grave and sustained irony of Sat. 2, 4, when no Lu-
 cilian inﬂuence is discernible, is much superior to this.

 question is ironical, as if the object
 of a formal dinner was to satisfy
 a natural hunger.

 6——9. Our knowledge of Roman
 dinner customs is imperfect, the
 fashions changed from time to
 time, and this description is meant
 to be only a series of allusions.
 It is therefore quite impossible to
 arrange the menu or even to de-
 cide whether this course consti-
 tuted the gustatio (promulsis) ; the
 relishes served with the boar would
 indicate that it did; the fact that

 no drink (mulsum) is mentioned
 would, however, be a strange
 omission.

 was supposed to affect the ﬂavor
 of the meat; cf. Sat. 2, 2, 32 ﬂ‘.

 the Alban, in the time of Horace,
 and F alernian. The Chian was a
 ﬁne Greek wine, with which sea-
 water was sometimes sparingly
 mixed to give it a tang. Horace
 frequently mentions these and
 other special kinds of wine, con-
 trasting them with the ordinary
 Sabine wine, as we might contrast
 special French or German wines
 with Californian claret, but he does
 not make sharp distinctions be-
 tween them. The preference for
 Caecuban came later, when the
 vineyards were dying out and the
 wine was becoming rare. The
 many attempts of commentators
 to ﬁnd hidden meanings in these
 lines are all misleading. The

 18 f. Divitias minus: ‘ oh, the

 This exclamation interprets to us

 The unfortunate host thinks that
 the wines and cookery which his
 money can buy are the things that
 make a successful dinner. But
 Horace goes to the root of the mat-

 PREFACE

 IT has been taken for granted in the preparation of
 this edition that the Epistles are not read until after the
 Satires and perhaps after the Odes, and parallels in the ‘
 earlier poems have been rather freely used for illustra-
 tion. In other respects the commentary is like that upon
 the Saﬁres, and is intended to direct the attention of the
 reader both to the artistic structure of the Epistles and to
 the body of ideas which Horace was endeavoring to ex-
 press in them. I have tried to remember that the student,
 learning his lessons, is in reality a reader.

 E. P. MORRIS.

 INTRODUCTION

 THE. Epistles were written, with perhaps a single exception,
 between 23 B.C. and 17. No event of Horace’s life during this
 period is on record, but from occasional references in his writ-
 ings it is to be seen that he was at this time living a ’quiet life,
 partly in Rome, more often on his farm, and sometimes in the
 winter months at Baiae or in Southern Italy. His circle of
 friends was large and included many men of high character and
 position, both in literature and in public life. But it was already
 a narrowing circle. Men of the earlier generation, whom he
 had known when he was a young man, were passing 03 the
 stage and, of his contemporaries, Quintilius Varus had died in
 23, Vergil died in 19, and Varius not long after. He was
 already, at a little more than forty, feeling himself to be a rep-
 resentative of an older generation. On the other hand, as the
 letters show, he was on terms of friendly intercourse with the
 younger men of all sets, and he seems, indeed, to have made
 a deliberate eﬁort to cultivate and maintain such relations. His
 own position in literature was assured. There is evidence,
 it is true, that he was not beyond the reach of criticism; the
 tone of Epirt. 1, 19 shows that; and it is possible that the ﬁrst C
 reception of the Odes had been less favorable than he had
 hoped it would be. Undoubtedly, also, the school of the docti,
 the poets and critics who preferred the more ornate manner
 of the Alexandrian literature, was at this time strong in popular
 favor. But, with all allowance for the difference between con-
 temporary judgments and the judgment of posterity, it is quite

 INTRODUCTION

 _ certain that Horace was, at the time when the Epistles were

 written, a leader, perhaps a sort of dean of letters, among
 Roman writers.

 The course of his life as an artist up to the year 23 B.C. is
 , clearly revealed in his writings. He had begun by writing
 satires in the general form set by Lucilius, but ﬁnding this in
 several ways unsuited to his temperament and recognizing its
 artistic limitations, he had made such modiﬁcations in it as to
 amount to the creation, or perhaps the crystallization, of a new
 literary form, the sermo, the ‘talk’ on life and art. ” These
 modiﬁcations were carried still further in the Second Book of
 the Satires; the dialogue, which in the earlier book is only half
 recognized, becomes in the Second Book the framework of the
 sermo, and is worked out in the different satires with very great
 care. During the same period, before 30 B.C., Horace was also
 making his ﬁrst attempts in lyric poetry. For this he chose
 the somewhat restricted ﬁeld of iambi, that is, of the form that
 had been ﬁxed by Archilochus, in which the iambic couplet was
 used to express a more emotional satire than could be expressed
 in hexameters. He did not, however, remain long content with
 this simple form; it was only the bridge that carried him over
 from satire to the more complex lyric.

 .The Odes, of which three books were published as a com«
 pleted whole in 23, represent a second and quite distinct stage
 in Horace’s artistic development. In them he did not consider
 that he was creating a new art form, but only that he was intro-
 ducing into Latin literature a form which had not before been
 used there, the lyric form of Alcaeus λψρ-ἕψῃς). We have
 too little of the Greek lyric poetry to be able to judge in detail
 of -the closeness with which he followed his models, and it
 would perhaps not be correct to claim for him more than he
 claimed for himself. Yet it is probable enough that, as he
 became master of this new form and learned to use it freely
 for his own purposes, he did with it what Vergil had done with

  

 INTRODUCTION

 the idylls of Theocritus, that is, employed it for purposes
 different from those for which it was used by its originators.
 The connected group of Alcaic odes which stand at the begin-
 ning of -the Third Book would then represent a modiﬁcation
 in use like that which is represented in Vergil’s Fourth Eelogue.
 Such an adaptation of the Alcaic stanza to new uses is in fact
 a modiﬁcation and development of the artistic form, less in
 amount than Horace had undertaken in the development of
 the Lucilian satire, but similar in kind and revealing the same
 underlying artistic purpose.

 Horace’s career, then, as an artist, had been, up to the year
 23 B.C., that of a man whose interest had been in the shaping
 of given poetic forms to new uses. Invsatire the modiﬁcations
 had been deliberate and of considerable effect, so that he was
 in this ﬁeld almost a creator; in lyric poetry the adaptations
 had been of narrower scope, yet not without inﬂuence upon the
 poetic form. He was now to take up a third form of literature,
 the Epistle.

 The history of the epistle as a literary form is not yet wholly
 clear. In early Latin literature it was used chieﬂy for practical
 ends. Cato published letters addressed to his son, probably
 of a didactic character, and there existed in Cicero’s time a
 collection of letters by *Cornelia to her sons, the Gracchi.
 Cicero’s own letters have come down to us, a most interesting
 collection, but they are real letters and can have been only
 in an incidental way models for Horace. In'verse the historical
 sequence is even less clear. The custom of dedicating a poem
 to an individual by a direct address, as Horace inscribes his

 ﬁrst satire to Maecenas, is an approach to the epistolary form; ·

 no distinct line can be seen between the manner in which Lucre-
 tius addresses Memmius at intervals in the de Rerum Natura
 and the occasional address to the Pisones in the Ars Poetica.
 Some of the poems of Catullus are epistolary in form and even
 in substance. But from these scattered approximations to the

 9

 INTRODUCTION

 epistolary type we are not able to form an accurate conception
 of any models that Horace may have had before him or even
 to be sure that he had such models at all.

 The artistic problem, however, is clear. It was to unite two
 elements, the personal and the public, into a harmonious whole,
 that is, to preserve a measure of personality and individuality
 and a certain degree of spontaneity, and' at the same time to
 introduce a considerable element of a kind that would be inter-

 “ esting to the general reader. The two are to some extent

 antagonistic. The easy confidence which characterizes the best
 private letters is so delicate that it almost surely disappears
 if it is known to the writer that the letter is to be read by others
 than the person addressed. Yet if this disappears entirely, the
 epistle is a letter only in form. In the solution of this problem,
 Horace has gone from one side to the other, as circumstances
 led him, allowing ﬁrst one, then the other, element to predomi-
 nate. The invitation to dinner (I, 5) addressed to Torquatus
 is so personal and natural that this may well have been a real
 letter for a real purpose, put into verse form for the mere pleas-
 ure of the writer and for the compliment which it paid to the
 recipient. “ The same thing is true of 1, 9, introducing Septimius
 to Tiberius. One of the three Epistles to Maecenas (1, 7) is
 extremely personal, both to the writer and to the recipient, so
 much so that it seems almost too conﬁdential for publication,
 yet it contains some of Horace’s best stories and is in parts not
 distinguishable from Sat. 2, 6. In others, 1, 3; I, 11; 1, 12;
 1, 15, the situation of the recipient or the writer is made the
 occasion ,for comments equally interesting to the general public;
 in r, 3 this has been done with special success, and the two
 elements are so harmoniously blended that it is impossible to
 tell whether this is really a letter, sent as is implied, or an
 Epistle written on the model of a personal letter. At the other
 extreme, r, 16 opens with a description of the farm, but runs
 off into a poem which has nothing of the tone of a letter in it,
 ιο

 INTRODUCTION

 while 1, 2 is a letter chieﬂy by virtue of the address and the
 closing lines, and 1, 6 is not a letter at all, but a sermo on
 philosophy addressed to an individual. To the skillful mingling
 of these two elements, the personal and the public, Horace has
 plainly devoted much thought, shaping the Epistle into a
 literary form, as he had shaped the dialogue-satire, and per-
 haps extending its range, as he had extended the range of the
 Alcaic stanza. _

 All this, however, applies chieﬂy to the First Book. In the
 Second Book there is less attempt to preserve the epistolary
 form. The Ars Poetica has scarcely anything but the address
 to remind the reader that it is an Epistle. In 2, 2 the ﬁction
 of excusing himself from further writing of lyrics is used by
 Horace to furnish a framework for the thought through the
 ﬁrst half, but the latter part is quite impersonal. The letter
 to Augustus (2, 1) is inevitably formal, but the consciousness
 that it is addressed to one who had it in his power to inﬂuence
 the trend of literary taste is present through the whole and inﬂu-
 ences the thought.

 It is not to be thought, however, that Horace’s attention was
 given wholly to the form of his writings. He was primarily
 an artist in words and phrases and forms of expression, but he
 had also something to say. In the First Epistle he announces
 the subject of the new collection; he has given up lyric poetry
 and is to devote himself hereafter to philosophy, not, indeed, o
 the philosophy of a sect, but the philosophy of life. This
 announcement fairly describes the subject-matter or the point
 of view of the book. A few of the Epistles (1, 5; 1, 9; 1, 13)
 make no reference to it; in others (1, 2; 1, 4; 1, 6; 1, 16) it is
 the staple of the Epistle; in several, including some of the best
 (1, 33 1, 8; 1, u; I, 12; 1, 15), it is not quite the subject, but
 is the conclusion, as if to show how in the writer’s mind all
 things lead back to the large philosophy of life. But Horace
 was not by temper or habit a student or what is called a pro-

 n

 INTRODUCTION

 found thinker. He was a man who had seen much of life on
 various sides, had observed many‘ men and had given serious
 thought to their conduct and his own. Out 'of this experience
 and consideration, he had come to certain conclusions which
 he had formulated into what we call, loosely, a philosophy of
 life. It was not, of course, a philosophy of the schools; it did
 not concern itself with questions of natural or physical science
 or with the nature of knowledge, and, though it was ethical, it
 did not involve the fundamental problems of ethics. But it had
 this in common with ethical philosophy, that it was based upon
 a real comprehension of vital interests and that it was to Horace
 a true and determining principle of life. In this sense he was
 justiﬁed in regarding himself as a philosopher and in feeling
 it to be his right and his duty to summon other men to accept
 his doctrine. He is thus, as indeed he had been in the earlier
 days of the Satires, a preacher, uttering his doctrine with con-
 viction and seriousness. Perhaps it should rather be said that
 he was at once preacher and artist. The variety of setting and
 of personalities which a collection of letters involves afforded
 him an opportunity to set forth his philosophy with variety,
 as a climax and a final answer to all troubles and queries and-
 situations.

 The subject of the Second Book is literature; the three long
 letters consist of comments on the prevailing tendencies of
 . literature in Rome. In this comment some two or three ele»
 ments are combined. Horace had read, though perhaps not
 very deeply or widely, the treatises on rhetoric and on the
 history of literature, and he made considerable use of the knowl-
 edge thus acquired. Much of this, however, must be recognized
 as conventional and traditional, without any very real connection
 with the condition of things in Rome. Especially the history
 of literature, of the drama or the satura, or the origins of certain
 poetic forms, which was once accepted as authoritative, must
 not be taken seriously. Horace had no access to real sources,

 12

  

 INTRODUCTION

 for example, of the early Latin literature; no such sources ex-
 isted. This element in his writings has no great value or inter-

 est. A second element has more life in it; in so far as his
 ’ comments reveal the tendencies of contemporary literature, they
 have real value. The extant remains of the literature of the
 Augustan Age, even though they include so much, are but
 scanty in amount compared with the writings of all kinds that
 were published in that period, and all the glimpses that we get
 in Horace of the work of younger men or of minor writers
 enable us to understand better the literature that has survived.
 A third element is the most important of all; it is the personal
 judgment which Horace expresses. For the work of the critic
 he was all the better qualiﬁed because his own work was not
 inspired, but was the result of a conscious process. He had
 thought much of the choice of words, of the combination of
 phrases, of the enlargement of vocabulary, and all that he says
 on such things is weighty with authority. One of the most
 interesting of experiences is to hear a good craftsman speak of
 the art that he practices. It is this which makes Cicero’s
 Brutus and Orator interesting; Horace’s presentation is more
 indirect than Cicero’s and less systematic, but it has the same

 essential quality of authority.

 “ It is not always possible to distinguish these three elements,
 the traditional, the contemporary, and the personal, but so far
 as it is possible it throws much light upon the meaning of these
 Epistles. Thus it is probable that the great space given to the
 drama has nothing to do with Horace’s own interest; it may
 be due to some transient public interest, but it is probably a
 tradition from the books of rhetoric. On the other hand, it is
 not unlikely that the discussion of the satyric drama is to be
 explained by a revived interest in mimes and farces. But
 much of the general discussion of poetry, the injunctions to fre-
 quent revision, the constant reference to Greek models, comes
 from Horace himself and constitutes the most attractive element

 33

 INTRODUCTION

 in these writings. For behind the artist and critic the Epistles
 reveal to us a man of most human temper and judgment, at once
 shrewd and mellow, by turns an observer of men and a lover
 of retirement. To turn back after reading the latest of these
 letters, Epist. 2, 1, and reread Sal. 1, 7 and 1, 8, is to see what
 some twenty years of life had done for Horace.

 The date of this Epistle is not ﬁxed by any deﬁnite allusion in the
 text. It is, however, clearly introductory to the book and was therefOre
 written after the others, at about the same date as Epist. 20, in the
 year 20 B.C. This was three years after the publication of the ﬁrst
 three books of the Odes ; the writer was nearly forty-ﬁve years old.

 ‘ My dear Maecenas, you are proposing that I should go back to my
 verse writing. I must decline the invitation ; I have won my discharge

 and am through with the follies of youth. Philosophy is now my only .

 interest. “What school?” you ask. My own school ; sometimes I
 rise to Stoic heights, and then, before I know it,I am a follower of Aris-
 tippus.⁴ But, school or no school, I am impatient of delay. For even
 the rudiments of philosophy have their value ; they will cure our ava-
 rice, our ambition, our laziness. And to get rid of our faults is the
 beginning of wisdom. See what pains men take to satisfy their desires,
 when half the labor would rid them of the desire itself. But all the
 Roman world is money-mad and careless, in its madness, of the higher
 claim of character.

 ‘I know that I am setting myself against the common judgment, but
 the common judgment is both inconsistent and inconstant. It is, in
 fact, a ludicrous exhibition of whims and contradictions. You laugh at
 it yourself, as you laugh, rightly enough, at my carelessness in dress.
 But don’t you see that carelessness in regard to the principles of life is
 much worse ? This is the very thing that I am trying to cure by the
 study of philosophy. I tell you, philosophy is a cure for everything—
 except inﬂuenza.’

 This introductory epistle has two objects, which are not distinctly
 stated, but are left to be inferred from the general tone. The ﬁrst is

 I5

 r, i, ι] HORATI

 to explain the writer's change from lyric poetry back to the social
 comments with which he began his career in the Satires. This is
 accomplished by the device of a supposed requestfrom Maecenas-
 which may or may not have been real—that Horace would continue
 his writing of lyrics. In answering this request the writer is able to
 give, without the appearance of egotism, his reasons for following a
 different course. The second purpose is to announce the fact that this
 collection of writings contains, more distinctly than the Satires, a kind
 of life philosophy, not systematic and not too serious, yet by no means
 wholly humorous.

 Of the change of form, from the satire to the epistle, nothing is said.
 It is evident and is left to explain itself.

 losoph y Horace proposed to attach
 himself is one which, in fact, would
 not have been asked by Maecenas
 or by any reader of the Satires and
 Odes, since Horace has made it
 abundantly clear that he did not
 belong to any school. But the
 question with the humorous an-
 swer, vss. 34-19, leads on to the
 illustrations of a practical social
 philosophy, which make up the
 main body of the epistle. —lare:
 a school of philosophy was some-
 times mlled familia or domus
 (Carm. 1, 29, I4) and might there-
 fore be supposed to have a hearth
 and a Lar famaliaris.

 14. addictus: property of a
 debtor, bound over or assigned to
 the creditor, but also used of a

 38

 gladiator; the line is thus a remi-
 niscence of vss. 2—6 and the ﬁgure
 is continued in iurare and magis·
 tri, which may be either master
 of a gladiatorial school or of a
 philosophical Sect.

 15. tempestas: the figure was
 a common one; cf. Cic. Acad.

 16-17. The sense is ‘I become
 for a time a Stoic.’ -— agilis : πρακ-
 τικός. The Stoic doctrine was
 that intelligent action was a neces-
 sary part of the philosopher’s life
 and that he should therefore take
 his part in public matters. — There
 is humorous irony in almost every
 word of vs. 37, especially verae,
 custos, rigidus.

 18-19. ‘Then again I slip
 quietly back into the school of
 Aristippus.’ Cf. the story referred
 to in Sat. 2, 3, 300 fi), which illus-
 trates the way in which Aristippus
 released himself from the bondage
 of things. -There is irony also in
 these lines, in furtim, relabor, conor.

 qnod: i.e., ‘of devoting myself

 25—26. Instead of using some
 single word for philosophy (vir-

 tus, sapientia, vs. 41) or some
 phrase like verum atque decens
 (vs. 11) which would emphasize

 the theoretical side, Horace here ·

 lays stress upon philosophy as a
 guide in the practical affairs of life.
 There is a half-humorous earnest-

 only prodcst, but also (si neglectum

 all ages and conditions.

 Epod. 1, 33 f., and often—cupi-
 dine: the general term, passion,
 following the particular; they
 mean only one thing, as hunc
 dolorem shows.

 34. verba et voces: words and
 sayings, i.e., teachings of philoso-
 phy which will be as eﬁ‘ectual as
 the magic formulas by which dis-
 ease is cured. This does not
 imply a real belief in charms, any
 more than the English phrase ‘it
 acts like magic.’ The line is a
 paraphrase of a well-known line
 of Euripides, Hippol. 478.

 35. morbi: a translation of πιέ-

 .00g, the technical term for a dis-
 turbing passion, used here with
 literal meaning also; cf. ferna,
 lenire, dolorem, tumes, recreare,

 Christian teaching—is summed

 280. —ferus: a change of ﬁgure;
 the cure of envy or hot temper
 by philosophy is like the taming

 cnlturae: properly of the cultiva-
 tion of land, but in this line the
 ﬁgurative meaning is almost lost
 sight of and patientem commodet
 aurem is used simply of the lis-
 tener to philosophie teaching.

 41, prim: with virtus as well
 as with sapientia. The sentence is
 used in a condensed form (prima

 21

 virtus est vitio carere) by Quin-
 tilian, 8, 3, 41, aud was probably
 a current maxim of philosophy.
 It summarizes and enforces the
 thought of vss. 28—40; ⁴it is
 worth while to take the ﬁrst steps
 by listening to the teachings of
 wisdom, by which our faults may
 be cured. For to get rid of our
 follies is the beginning of wisdom.’
 At the same time it introduces
 the argument of 42-52; ‘take the
 ﬁrst steps, which are not diﬂicult;
 for half the labor you spend in

 this cannot be simply ‘labor of

 ‘trouble of. spirit,’ capitis· labor is

 therefore be translated twice, ‘ anx-

 learning from philosophy to be

 like vicit Olympia, Cic. Cat. Ill.
 14, both from the Greek στεφανοῦ-

 51. sine pulveres ἀκονιτί. The
 expression was proverbial and was
 extended beyond its strict mean-
 ing, so that it came to be used of
 prizes awarded to athletes whose
 fame was so great that no one
 dared to contend with them. It
 suggests therefore the ease with
 which the beneﬁts of philosophy
 may be obtained, in contrast to
 the struggles necessary to get
 money or satisfy ambition (44—46).

 52. The conclusion of the argu-
 ment; ‘just so character, the pro-

 the rewards which men rate so
 high.’ But, as often, the conclu-

 assertion, without indication of its
 connection (Sat. 1, 1, 59 f., 78 f.,
 105 ; ι, 3, 24; 1, 6, 23, and often),

 54. summus ab imo: from top

 end. But the precise meaning of
 the phrase as applied to Ianus is
 not clear, because our knowledge
 of the topography of the Forum in
 the Augustan period is very
 limited. The same spot is re-
 ferred to in Sat. 2, 3, 18 (medfus
 Ianus) and by Cicero as the center
 of the banking business in Rome;

 58. quadringentis: sc. milibus
 sestertzicm. This sum, 400,000
 sesterces, was the rating necessary
 to enrollment among the equites.
 -sex uptem: used in this way,
 without connective, in several
 other places (Ter. Eun. 331, Cic.
 Alt. IO, 8, 6), apparently for
 phonetic reasons. No other car-
 dinal numbers are so used.

 59—60. The full verse is given
 by the Scholiast: ‘réx erit qui
 récte faciet, qui non faciet nén
 erit,’ a trochaic septenarius, sung
 by boys in some game.

 ﬁgure to express security and stabil-
 ity, here in contrast to the troubles
 of a life spent in the pursuit of
 money or position (43-46). The
 whole of vs. 63 is nothing but an
 expansion of recte facere.——con-
 sciret absolute, as the noun con-
 scientia is occasionally. -sibi : not
 tibi, bemuse the words are a maxim
 of general application. The line
 should be paraphrased, rather than
 rendered literally.

 62. Roscia . . . lex: the law
 which reserved the ﬁrst fourteen
 rows behind the orchestra for the
 knights. As the equites were in
 general the eapitalists, the law is
 taken as an embodiment of the
 public opinion which gave undue
 honor to wealth (vs. 53).

 63. nenia: used of any rhyme or
 jingle in rhythm, like charms and
 proverbs, in distinction from formal
 poetry. Here with intention, to
 contrast the song of boys at play
 with the law of the Roman people.

 24

 64. minibus: manly. As these
 heroes of the good old times sang
 the verse when they were boys,
 so they acted upon the principle
 when they bemme men. Curius
 and Camillus are named together
 in Carm. 1, 12, 41 f. as products
 of saeva paupertas.

 65—66. rem...rem...rem:
 the repetition is made more em-
 phatic by the position of the
 monosyllable at the end of the

 dependent fac.

 67. propius: i.e., ⁴become a
 knight by reason of your money

 Pupi: unknown. The Scholiast
 quotes a couplet in which Pupius
 is supposed to pride himself upon
 his success in moving his audience
 to tears. But lacrimosa is of course
 ironical, like all the rest of the line.

 68. responure: defy, as in Sat.

 used of a god who is present in

 91-93. ‘And as the rich man

 the poor man in his small way
 indulges his mprices.’ All the
 details are intentionally petty;
 cenacula, lodgings, is a parody
 upon vss. 83—87, the lectos, balnea,
 tonsores are the cheap luxuries
 of the poor, and the poor man,
 seasick in his hired boat, is an
 especially keen hit. There is in
 these lines a tone of sharpness
 not usual in Horace and more
 like the bitterness of Juvenal⁷s

 94-108. ‘These and other like

 serious anger, but humorously and
 with recognition of the friendly
 concern which causes the annoy-
 ance of Maecenas. ‘Though you
 are so anxious to have me avoid
 even the most triﬂing carelessness.’

 105. The line is an explicit and
 intentional profession of friendship,
 to guard against the possibility
 that the preceding reproaches
 (94-104) addressed directly to
 Maecenas might be taken too
 seriously by any reader.

 humorous conclusion of Sat. 1, ι ;

 25—24. This letter was therefore written somewhere between 24
 and 20.

 Beyond this nothingis known of the young man, but he may well
 have been a relative of the distinguished M. Lollius to whom Carm. 4,
 9, is addressed. .

 ‘My dear young friend, I have just been re-reading Homer and
 am struck with the wealth of illustration of philosophic doctrines
 in his poems. He is really better than the philosophers themselves.
 Just consider the debate between Antenor and Paris or the quar-
 rel between the two chiefs of the Greeks. The follies of kings could
 not be better shown. And Ulysses, in the Odyssey, is as good as
 a Stoic ; recall the description of him in the opening of the poem.
 And you and I are there, too, in the picture of the easy-going Phaea-
 Clans.

 ⁴ But don‘t be too easy-going; don't postpone too long the beginning
 of serious philosophic living. There are temptations everywhere. Do
 not be like the men who hope to ﬁnd happiness in their possessions,
 instead of cleansing their own hearts. Avoid pleasure, love of money,
 envy, anger; especially anger. Begin early to train yourself. But
 don’t expect me to be your companion in the path of reform; lam
 middle-aged and I go my own sober way.’

 The tone of the letter is half serious, half light, as suits an older
 man’s advice to a younger friend. It is probable that the advice has
 some personal applications which can no longer be understood, but the
 general tenor is impersonal; begin in youth to train yourself to virtue.

 In the Satires there is a nearer approach to it. In this letter it is

 attained.

 1. terrarumz the plural makes
 the question more general; cf.
 ubi terrarum.-militet= he was
 in command of troops, though the
 mission was not in reality a cam-
 paign. —oris: distant lands5 ora
 is not necessarily a seashore, but
 any edge; cf. ‘ends of the earth.’

 a. Claudius: Tiberius Claudius
 Nero, the stepson and successor of
 Augustus, not yet adopted as a son..
 -laboroz so Sat. 2, 8, 19, nosse
 Zahara; repeated in curo, vs. 6.

 3. Thracaz the form Thracia is
 later. In the Odes Horace uses
 the Greek form Thraca-nivali

 . . vinctus: this ﬁxes the time
 of the year. But compede vinctus
 is not to be taken quite literally;
 the cold of Thrace was proverbial.

 4. Ῐῐοῒει the Hellespont, on op-
 posite sides of which stood, in
 poetic tradition, the towers of Hero

 and Leander, near Sestos and
 Abydos. The Hellespont is here
 less than a mile wide (vicinas) and
 the current runs swiftly.

 6. studiosa cohors: the suite οξ
 young men who accompanied
 Tiberius, as Catullus went on the
 staff of Memmius to Bithynia(
 Tiberius was himself in early life
 interested in literature and was
 doubtless inclined to follow the
 example of Maecenas and Messala
 and Augustus in the patronage of
 men of letters.—operum: with
 quid,- in this context necessarily
 works of literature. ”

 7. sumit: chooses, takes upon
 himself. This is the task which
 had more than once been sugg
 gested to Horace (cf. Sat. 2, I,
 ιο ΗΣ), but which he had always
 declined to undertake. There is
 a little irony in sumit.

 8. Mundltz of the extensive"

 circulation that an epic poem on
 Augustus ought to merit—in
 mum: such a poem should be
 good enough to endure for all time.

 9. Titium unknown. The ac-
 counts in the Scholiasts are made
 up from the text.—inon: so in
 the epitaph attributed to Ennius,
 volito per ora virum,· ‘ soon to
 be famous in Rome.’

 ro—rr. non oxpalluit: it required
 a certain audacity to attempt a
 Pindaric ode (cf. Carm. 4, 2, 1,
 Pindarum quisquis· studet aemu-
 lari). The thought is repeated in
 positive form in ausus, vs. 11. For
 the accus. haustus cf. Carm. 3, 27,
 27, fraudes palluit-The con-
 trast between the draughts from
 the fountain of the Muses on Heli-
 con and the waters of the public
 pool (lacus) or the stream, easy of
 access to all (apertos), is used by
 Quintilian, ιο, I, 109, non enim
 pluvias, ut ait Pindarus, aquas
 colligit, sed vivo gurgite exundat,
 with a slightly different sense.

 r3. Thebnnoe: z‘.e., Pindaric. --
 guspioe mun: ‘with the help of
 the Muses’; the sense is affected

 fastidire lag-us et rivos ausus apertos?L qd “'

 νίἹ

 by the proximity of studet, so that
 it mans ‘ hoping for the blessing
 of the Muses.’

 14. desaevitz only here in Horb
 ace. The word is coined to go
 with ampullatur and to express
 humorously, because it is coined,
 the high emotions of tragedy.—
 ampullatur: a translation of ληκυ-
 θίζει (cf. A. P. 97). This word,
 from ληκύθος, ampulla, a ﬂask. was
 used in derision of the tendency
 of tragedy to run into bombast.
 The figure seems to be taken from
 the hollow humming sound made
 by the wind in the neck of a jar.
 -It is certainly impossible to take
 these lines, which are in eﬂ'ect a
 message to Titius, quite seriously;
 the phrasing (non expalluit, aum,
 auspice, musa, desaevit, ampulla-
 tur) forbids that interpretation.
 But neither can they be taken, in
 so friendly a letter meant for pub-
 lication, as mere irony. They are
 the friendly banterings of an older
 man addressed to a young friend
 of high ambitions and they are at
 the same time a reminder of the
 writer's disinclination to attempt
 either tragedy or the Pindaric ode.

 Was used by Augustus on the
 advice of his physician (Sueton.
 Aug. 81) and ’was at this time in

 like hederae praemia, "vs. 25. Cf.
 Cic. chin. 2, 29, 95, pata-ntiae,

 could bring yourself to give up
 the practice of treating your soul
 with the cold-water bandages that
 your anxieties wrap around you,
 you would follow where philosophy
 would lead.’ — sapientia : this
 single reference, with the two vss.

 the social philosophy which is the
 general‘theme of this Book.

 erence to the circumstances of

 33- rerum inscitia. 1.e., ⁴1nex
 rience in life, in affairs.’ As cali-
 dus sanguis would be to a young
 man a grateful excuse, so rerum
 inscitia is just the form of reproach
 which would be most efﬁcacious in
 bringing him back to good sense.

 34. oervico: like young cattle
 or horses that have not yet felt
 the yoke.

 35- vivitis indignit to be taken
 together; indigni is the important
 word; ‘you ought not, wherever
 you may be (cf. vs. 1), to break so
 close a friendship.’

 ‘ 36. ‘Nor shall I permit it; for
 I feel affection for you both, and

 reditum vo ’va iuvenca.
 3. “4,... At, x .‚\-

 you must dine together at my
 house when you return.’

 Vss. 30-36 are a kind of post-
 script containing the only wholly
 serious thoughts of the epistle.
 The opening word, debes, connects
 them directly with the preceding
 exhortation to philosophy, and the
 closing invitation to both to dine
 with him is a most graceful expres-
 sion of his determination to see
 their friendship renewed. The
 lines are scrupulously neutral and
 yet there is not a word that could
 give offense to F lorus. It would
 not be possible to express such
 thoughts as these with greater tact.

 4.

 The date of this Epistle cannot be definitely fixed. The absence of
 any allusion to the Odes in vs. 1 seems to require a date before 23 n.c.,
 when the Odes were published, and the reference to a favorable judg-
 ment expressed by Tibullus in regard to the Satires points to a still
 earlier date. Tibullus returned to Rome from a campaign in Aquitania
 in 27 and may then for the ﬁrst time have read the Satires.

 Albius Tibullus, addressed in this epistle and in Carm. 1, 33, the
 elegiae poet, was a younger friend of Horace and a man of attractive
 character. He was, however, of a somewhat melancholy temperament,
 and this note of general invitation and inquiry is intended to cheer him.

 ‘What are you doing at your home in Pedum, my dear Albius?
 Writing or philosophizing in silence ? The gods have given you much;
 be grateful for what you have. If you will make me a visit, you will
 ﬁnd me fat and cheerful, as an Epicurean ought to be.’

 reminding him that there is noth-
 ing unusual in his experience.

 are humorously clothed in allu-
 sions to his physical well-being.
 It is said of him in the Vita of
 Suetonius, habitu corporis brevis
 fuit atque obesus. - cute: cf.,
 Epist. 1, 2, 29, note—vines: i.e.,
 ‘you shall ﬁnd me in the best of
 condition, when you come to see
 me, as I hope you will.’— grege:
 in a double sense, as the usual
 word for a school of philosophy,
 and with reference to porcum. -
 porcum: often used as a term of
 reproach of Epicureanism, which
 the Romans generally understood
 only in its less elevated form.

 The year in which this Epistle was written is left entirely uncertain,
 as is natural in an invitation to dinner. The day of the month was

 Sept. 22d (vs. 7).

 Torquatus was probably of the family of the Manlii Torquati, a lawyer
 and orator, but otherwise unknown. He is addressed in Carm. 4, 7,
 where his genus, facundia, and pietas are mentioned.

 The letter has all the appearance of being a real invitation to a dinner
 that actually took place on a special occasion. Two things make it

 43

 1, 5, ι] HORATI

 wdrthy of preservation in this collection of letters. It is, in the ﬁrst
 place, a very successful illustration, in concrete form, of a fundamental
 principle of Horace’s social philosophy. He is here in the position of
 the host of no wealth or social position approaching a man of high
 standing and of importance in the world of aﬁairs. The merit of the
 invitation is that it recognizes these differences, but with such openness
 and humor as to show that the writer did not overestimate their impor-
 tance and was conﬁdent that his guest also did not give them undue
 weight. As host, Horace is humorously profuse in saying that he is
 making anxious preparations for the dinner ; as a friend, he takes for
 granted the absolute equality which is the only foundation for friend-
 ship, ’without either servility or self-assertion. To this subject his rela-
 tion to Maecenas had led Horace to give careful attention, and it is the
 theme of Sat. 1, 6 and of two Epistles, 7 and 18, of this Book.

 In the second place, the occasion gave an opportunity for the recom-
 mendation of that philosophy of moderate enjoyment of pleasure to
 which Horace so frequently recurs. The praise of wine was a standing
 theme of Greek and Roman lyric ; an invitation to dinner ﬁirnished an
 appropriate motive for introducing it again.

 ι. Archiacis: the implication is 2. olus omne: i.e., ‘nothing but
 that this was some modest kind the plainest food.’—patella: the
 of couch, not quite ﬁtted for use diminutive form is expressive of
 at a dining table. The Scholiast the pretended humility.
 says Archias breves lectos fecit, 3. supremo solo: ‘at the end'
 which may be a genuine tradi- _of the day.’ The more usual
 tion.—conviva: to be taken with hour was in the middle of the
 recumberc,· ‘to recline as one does afternoon, but this dinner was· to
 at the table.’ Horace does not be prolonged into the night, ιο-
 use the ordinary verb, accumbere ,- ιι. V
 but it is possible that there is 4. iterum Tauroz sc. consule.
 some special point in recumbere,· Taurus was consul for the second

 vitiarume a more deﬁnite reference
 to the struggle for wealth which,

 45

 in Horace's judgment, was far too
 common at Rome; dz'w‘tz'arumis

 a direct allusion to a case which
 was then occupying the attention
 of Torquatus. Moschus was a
 rhetorician, accused of poisoning,
 and defended by Torquatus and
 Asinius Pollio.

 9. nato Csesare: to a reader of
 Horace’s time this bare phrase
 would have been perfectly intelli-
 gible; to us, knowing little of
 the circumstances, it is not clear
 whether the reference is to Julius
 Caesar or to Augustus. But we
 know of no custom of celebrating
 the birthday of Julius Caesar so
 long after his death and, on the
 other hand, the birthday of Augus-
 tus was an occasion for festivities
 (Sueton. Oct. 62). This fell on
 September 23, and we must there-
 fore take aestivam (vs. H) in a
 general sense. The weather would
 still be summer-like at that date. ——
 festus: there would be no session
 of courts and no public business.

 ‘ The steady composure of philosophy is the only source of happiness,
 NumiciusL If men can look without superstitious dread upon the won-
 ders of the universe, they must surely be able to look without passion
 upon the petty attractions of ambition and wealth, neither desiring their
 rewards nor fearing their loss. For they are all a passing show, here
 to-day and gone to-morrow. But the rewards of philosophy are

 permanent.

 your money is a mere superﬂuity to you and a temptation to thieves.
 Or is it oﬁice that is to make you happy ? Then crawl in the dirt to
 get votes. Or are you going to be a lover of good dinners P That is
 ' a simple ambition, and certainly a low one. Or is it to be love and
 jests ? You know where that ends.

 ‘If this statement of your views does not suit you, make a better one
 or else accept my ideals.’

 This Epistle is not a letter. In its general form it is not essentially
 different from the Satires of the First Book. The only indications of
 that personal tone which distinguishes a letter from a short essay are
 the purely formal address in vs. 1, the two closing lines, and the possi-
 ble allusion to the opinions of Numicius in vs. 31, virtutem verba putas.
 These, however, are too slight to produce the impression of a letter.
 For this reason it may be surmised that this is one of the earlier of the
 ” Epistles, in which Horace is endeavoring to shape a new form for his
 social comments, diﬁ‘erent from the Lucilian form of the First Book and
 from the dialogue form of the Second Book.

 In the substance of the Epistle, however, in the handling of the
 familiar though. about wealth and ambition, there is a decided change.
 Horace here writes as one to whom philosophy is a reality, an actual
 and accepted guide in the affairs of life. In this respect the Epistle is
 quite unlike the earlier work and this element brings it into harmony
 with the other writings in this collection.

 In spite of the personal allusions in the early part of this Epistle, it
 is impossible to determine with certainty the year in which it was
 written. Nor is it clear where Horace was when he wrote ; he was in
 the country, and it may be inferred from the fact that there is no refer-
 ence to his Sabine farm that he was at some other place in the moun-
 tains. Maeoenas was in Rome.

 ‘ I have changed my mind, my dear Maecenas, and am not coming to
 Rome now nor even soon. I shall go down to the coast for the winter
 and shall not see you, my dear friend, until spring comes. My debt to
 you is great, but I count with conﬁdence upon your consideration for

 - on his little island. So it is with me ; Rome is too big for me, and I
 am too small for Rome. Let me tell you a story. Philippus, the
 lawyer, once made acquaintance with a small tradesman and, partly for
 his own amusement, induced him to give up his life in Rome and turn
 farmer. The natural result followed; the amateur farmer came to
 utter grief. As he looked at the ruins, he saw his mistake, galloped
 back to Philippus and begged to be allowed to return the gift. The
 moral is‘that every man must go his own way.’

 This Epistle was written late in August or early in September.
 Horace had left Rome in midsummer, promising to return after a short
 stay in the mountains. He had, however, stayed for a month, and
 Maecenas, detained in Rome, had written him, asking him to come
 back and reminding him of his promise and probably of his obligation
 to his benefactor. To that letter Horace replies in this Epistle. The
 personal tone is strong in vss. 1-13, 24-28, 34—39, but the greater part
 of the Epistle consists of the four stories which are woven into it, the
 story of the Calabrian, vss. 14-19, of the fox, 29—33, of Telemachus,
 40-43, and the long story of Philippus, 46-95. The eﬁ'ect of the intro-
 duction of this large amount of impersonal material is to make the
 Epistle read like a Satire. And a comparison with Sat. I, 6 and
 Sat. 2, 6 will show that Horace has here, in treating a serious subject,
 returned in part to his earlier form. ' The fusion, however, of the two
 elements is carried out with great skill, and this Epistle is justly re-
 garded as one of the poet’s most ﬁnished productions.

 But the personal aspect of it is even more interesting than the artistic
 form. The position was one of real difﬁculty. It is handled with
 admirable independence and candor and with most friendly considera-
 tion for the feelings of Maecenas. Undoubtedly, as the fact of publica-
 tiOn shows, it was received by him with appreciation and with generous
 cordiality.

 th e address dulcis amice, is inserted
 with real delicacy of feeling into

 Rome not only through August and
 September, but all winter, until the

 connection is merely suggested, as
 often in Horace, by the contrast

 in Sat. 1, 6, 51, praesertim cautus

 24. dignusne as you, bonus et
 sapiens, are ready for the worthy,
 so I am ready to show myself dig-

 25—36. ‘I am indeed grateful, but

 no longer young, and you must not
 expect from me a constant attend-
 ance. If you expected that, I should
 have to remind you of the story of
 the fox in the corn bin and act
 according to the moral of the tale.’

 26. latus: lungs, chest; but we
 do not know that Horace suffered
 from any disease of the kind this
 would suggest. - nigrosz he says
 that he was praecanus, ‘gray be-
 fore his time’; Epist. r, 2o, 24.
 — angusta fronte= i.e., not yet be-
 ginning to get bald.

 27-28. ‘ Give me again the pow-
 er to enjoy the pleasures of youth.’
 The details are not meant to be

 personal, but general; ‘the pleas-
 ant voice and laughter of youth.q
 - Cinuae: cf. Carm. 4, 1, 3-4,
 non sum qualis eram bonae | sub
 regno Cinarae. She is the only
 one of the girls mentioned by Hor-
 ace who seems to have had a real
 existence.

 29. vulpecula= the fox is the
 hero of many of the Fables, as of
 many of the tales of Uncle Remus.
 In such stories almost no attention
 is paid to the real habits of the ani-
 mals; indeed, it is common to ﬁnd
 that in different versions the ani-
 mals are changed about freely, as,
 for example, this fable is also told
 with a mouse for the chief actor.

 30. cumenm: bin or jar for
 storing grain; cf. Sat. 1, 1, 53.

 32. procul: at a little distance ,·
 this is a common meaning; cf. Sat.

 35-36. altilium: with satur ,· it
 means, properly, fowls fattened for
 eating, then any specially fine food.
 The meaning is, ‘I am in earnest
 in saying cuncta resigno; I am not
 so inconsistent as to be praising a
 simple life while I live in luxury;
 I do not wish to give up my free-
 dom for all the wealth of Arabia.’

 37. verecundum: for my mod-

 Horace, but the difference was

 separation at this time, but in con-

 39. ‘ Try me and see whether I
 cannot do as I say, and without
 repining, too.’ laetus at the end
 of the line is emphatic.

 40-—43. Menelaus presented
 horses and a chariot to Telema-
 chus as an expression of friendship
 for him and his father. The reply
 of Telemachus, of which vss. 4x—
 43 are a paraphrase, is in Odys. 4,
 601 BI-patientisz an ornamental
 epithet, translating the Homeric
 πολύτλας.

 44-45. parvum paws: i.e., ‘so
 it is with me; I can accept only
 gifts that are suitable to my tastes,
 not gifts that require a change of

 royal, quiet, peaceful; the adjec-
 tives are carefully chosen to carry

 his unﬁtness for such a life as he
 must lead if he were to be con-

 51. proprios: thiswas sometimes

 This Epistle was written, either in the summer of the year 20 or in
 the next summer, to a young friend who was in the suite of Tiberius on
 his mission to the East. It goes, therefore, with Epirt. 1, 3, in which

 also Celsus is mentioned.

 ‘My greetings, O Muse, to Celsus ! If he asks of me, tell him that l

 am well in body, but not in spirit, that I am idle and hesitating and
 unsatisﬁed with myself. Ask, too, how it is with him and give him
 from me a friendly warning not to misuse his fortunes.’

 In this note the personal and the artistic motives are successfully
 combined. Both must be kept in mind in the interpretation of it. The
 fact that it was deliberately selected for publication is a warning against
 taking the personal element too seriously ; doubtless the bit of advice
 at the end had a real meaning, but neither that nor the expressions of
 discontent which skillfully pave the way for the advice should be over-
 interpreted. The warning is a very general one, such as might be
 addressed to many young men, and the sense of dissatisfaction with ·
 himself and his work is more than once expressed by Horace.

 -It is altogether probable, though it is not deﬁnitely stated, that this
 Epistle was written in the year 20, when Tiberius was making prepara-
 tions for his trip into Asia Minor. Of the Septimius whom the letter
 introduces nothing is known with certainty; but one of the Odes
 (Carm. 2, 6) is addressed. to a Septimius, and a man of this name is
 mentioned in a letter of Augustus to Horace, quoted in the Vita of
 Suetonius.

 Some other letters of introduction have come down to us (Cic. ad
 Fam. 2, 14 ; 7, 5 ; Pliny, 4, 4), but none so skillful and so charming as
 this, Tiberius, even as a young man, was both scornful and suspicious
 of the attentions paid to him on account of his relation to Augustus,
 but he was not incapable of perceiving the mingled frankness and defer-
 ence of such a letter as this. And he was also a lover of literature, to

 whom the delicate art of expression and thought would appeal strongl .

 There is nothing to ﬁx the date of this Epistle nor is Bullatius, to
 whom it was addressed, mentioned elsewhere.

 ‘ And how do you like the famous cities of Asia, my friend P Are you

 of travel. Pleasant scenery will not make you happy. It is better to
 stay at home and sing the joys of travel at your ease. For happiness is
 not in some distant future or in some far-off country; it is here and
 now, in our own hearts, if we are wise enough to take it.‘

 Horace was not a traveler. He went to Athens in early life for study,
 but after his return his life was spent in the neighborhood of Rome or
 about Tarentum. He was free from that form of restlessness which
 seeks excitement in novelty and was perhaps not quite just to those
 who ﬁnd stimulus in sight seeing. In this Epistle he has used the
 fact that Bullatius was abroad as an occasion for restating the doctrine

 which he often preaches, that the sources of happiness are within, s ι -

 ting it in contrast to the pleasures of travel.

 1, 32] ‚ HORATI

 This Epistle was written in the summer of the year 20 B.C., as the
 closing lines show. The person addressed, Iccius, is the same young
 man to whom, some ﬁve or six years before, Horace had written an ode,
 Carm. x, 29. He is otherwise unknown, but some traits of character
 are clearly revealed by the tone in which Horace addresses him. He
 was one of the circle of younger men whom Horace knew well, a stu-
 dent of philosophy, though probably not a serious scholar. He was
 not rich and was looking for an opportunity to make his way in the
 world. This he had sought to ﬁnd by joining the expedition of Gallus
 against the Persians and after the failure of this campaign he had be-
 come the agent of Agrippa, taking charge of his estates in Sicily. This
 Epistle was written in reply to a letter from Iccius, in which there was
 some expression of dissatisfaction with his position and of regret that
 business interfered with philosophy.

 ‘ The trusted agent of Agrippa, my dear young friend, should not call
 himselfa poor man. If one has plenty to eat and health to enjoy it, he
 is as rich as a king. Or if you have turned vegetarian, no amount of
 money will make any difference to such a philosopher. You are a
 greater wonder than Democritus, to be so active in business and at the
 same time so deep in philosophy. But, whether you are living high or
 have become an ascetic, don’t neglect my friend and your neighbor,
 Pompeius Grosphus ; he is a man you can trust.

 ‘The news at Rome is all cheerful ; victories everywhere and a ﬁne
 harvest in Italy)

 This is, in form, one of the most successful of the Epistles. It is
 precisely such a letter as might have been written in prose, com-
 menting upon the letter to which it is a reply, recommending a friend
 to the notice of the recipient and giving in brief the news of the
 day. Its tone, too, is entirely personal, as if it were meant to be
 read only by the person addressed, and that tendency to fall into the
 essay manner, which in some of the letters is out ‘of harmony with the
 epistolary form, is here the more easily avoided, because the interest of
 Iccius in philosophy makes the introduction of that subject quite
 natural. At the same time, the personal matters are so treated as
 to be of general interest, and the revelation of the character of both
 writer and recipient is most attractive. In lightness of touch and in
 humorous irony this letter resembles Epist. 1, 3, also addressed to a
 younger friend.

 its connection with frueris.

 3. querellam laments over his

 imply that Iccius was over-anxious

 5. ventri,lateri,pedibns: i.e. ‘if
 your wants are supplied and your
 health is good.’ The form in
 which the general thought is ex·
 pressed is taken from a Greek
 proverb (Theognis, 719), but Hor-
 ace uses the same words often,
 putting speciﬁc illnesses in the
 place of some general term; cf.
 latus aut renes, Eptict. ι, 6, 28;

 6. The same as non est ut copia
 maiam· cf. also Epzict. 1, 4, 7-8.

 7. forte: the addition of this
 word prevents the condition, si
 vivis, from assuming that he is
 actually living an ascetic life. The
 two conditions, si ventri bene est
 and si 111'er herbis, thus present
 the two possible alternations,
 without choosing between them;
 ‘whether you are living on the fat
 of the land or are, perhaps, a vege-
 tarian, in either case you are in-
 dependent of money and have no
 right to call yourself pauper.’—ln
 medic positorum: the gen. depends
 on abstemius, which takes theqabl.
 or the gen. without distinction of
 meaning. For in media posita,

 26-29. The news of the day,
 given in condensed form, with
 little touches of half-humorous

 ppetic phrasing. -Agrippa, the
 patron of Iccius, put down an up-
 rising in Spain in the summer of
 20 B.C. — The expedition of Ti-
 berius, to which reference is made
 in many of the Epistles, resulted
 in the submission of Armenia.—
 Phraates, king of Parthia, restored
 to Augustus, through Tiberius, the
 Roman standards taken long be-
 fore, when Crassus was defeated.
 The formalities of the occasion are

 ’ alluded to in genibus minor (‘in-

 ferior by his kneeling ’), and both

 ¹this event and the conquest of Ar-

 menia are'commemorated on coins
 of the period and mentioned by
 Augustus in the Monumentum
 Ancyranum. - defundit : present
 tense :_ the harvest was just coming
 in. There had been serious trouble
 from a bad harvest in 22 mc.

 The ﬁrst three books of the Odes were published in the year 23. At
 that time Augustus was still in Italy, in or near Rome, and Horace sent
 to him an early copy of the three volumes. The bearer of the gift was
 Vinnius Asina (or perhaps Asellus), of whom nothing is known except

 EPISTVLAE [I, I3, 4

 by inference from this letter. The Epistle is supposed to be a hasty
 note, sent by a messenger to overtake Vinnius before he reached Rome
 and to remind him again of the author’s instructions in regard to the
 manner in which the gift should be presented to Augustus.

 ‘ This is to remind you again, Vinnius, to be careful. Don’t make a
 nuisance of yourself ; your name, you see, exposes you to jibes. And
 do try to be graceful; don‘t carry my books under your arm like a com-
 mon bundle. And don’t brag about them, either. Remember what
 I’ve told you and do be careful.’

 This is not an actual letter, sent after Vinnius, but a humorous
 Epistle handed to him with the books and intended in reality for
 Augustus. There is not a serious word in it; the elaborate and fussy
 advice, the permission to throw the book away, the reference to the
 badness of the road, are all ﬁctitious. Vinnius was not a country down,
 but a common friend of Augustus and Horace, who undertook the little
 commission for the poet, doubtless with pride. Nor was Augustus
 so remote and great a personage that Horace felt it to be necessary
 to approach him with elaborate caution. All this belongs to the
 machinery, as it were, of the little play.

 The facts were, in reality, something like this: in sending a copy
 of his completed lyrics to Augustus, Horace desired to write a note of
 presentation, like an inscription on a ﬂyleaf. Seeking to avoid the
 commonplace forms, he hit upon the little ﬁction of pretending great
 anxiety about the reception of the gift and of expressing his anxiety in
 these fussy and exaggerated directions to the bearer. The note was,
 of course, to be shown to Augustus.

 14. glomus: acc. plur.; the
 word is a technical term, of wool
 gathered into a ball for spinning.
 —Pyrrhia: the form of the name
 is quite uncertain. The Scholiast
 says that this is an allusion to a
 soene in a play of Titinius.

 rs. conviva tribulis) a poorer
 member of a ‘tribe,’ invited to
 dinner for political purposes by
 a richer fellow-tribesman, would
 have no slave to carry his cap or
 to take his sandals when he re-
 clined on the couch. He would
 therefore carry them under his
 arm. — The three comparisons are
 not meant to describe three differ-
 ent ways of carrying things under
 the arm, but merely to suggest the
 awkwardness which Vinnius is to
 avoid. θ

 16-17. ‘And don‘t brag to
 everybody about your important
 mission.’ The important word in
 the inﬁn. phrase is not sudavisse,

 but ferendo. The exaggeration
 of sudavisse is like that in vss. 4—5,
 ιο, 11.

 ιδ. oratus: by Horace, in this
 letter.—multa prece: the whole
 Epistle is made up of such exhor-

 xg. titubes: a very common
 word in Plautus, in giving direc-
 tions for the carrying out of a plan;
 M.G. 946, Fund. 764, 939. The
 literal meaning is here distinctly
 in mind, with a reference back to
 vss. 8—9, and is carried on into
 frangas. - mandata: not the vol-
 umes, but the injunctions, the
 multae preces. The literal and
 ﬁgurative meanings run together;
 ‘don’t stumble and break your
 load,’ ‘don’t make a mistake and
 forget my directions to you.’

 The date of this Epistle cannot be determined nor is it of importance
 for the interpretation. The person to whom it is supposed to be written
 is the superintendent of Horace‘s farm.

 ‘Foreman of my nice little farm, we seem to be disagreeing. I am
 detained here in Rome, longing for the country; you want to be back

 85

 ι, 14, ι] HORATI

 in Rome. You are inconsistent and I am not, but the real difference is
 in our tastes. To you my farm seems a desert and a place of hard
 labor, and you long for pleasures, while I have dropped all that kind
 of thing and want only peace. Each wants what the other has. But
 it won’t do; the shoemaker will have to stick to his last, according to
 the old saying.’

 This Epistle is in complete contrast to the one which immediately
 precedes it. It is a little disquisition on the inconsistencies of men, as
 illustrated by the steward’s discontent with the life which he had once
 greatly desired, and on the attractiveness of the country, which seemed
 all the stronger to Horace when he happened to be detainedin Rome
 beyond his usual time. These themes Horace had treated before, in
 Sat. 1, 1 and Sat. 2, 6, using the satire form. In returning to them at
 this later time, under the impulse of his longing to escape from the city,
 he used the epistolary form with which he was then experimenting.
 The vilicus is, of course, a mere ﬁgurehead; the letter was not actually
 sent to him at all; but the advantages of the direct form of address
 appear in the individual allusions (vss. 2—3, 6-7, 14-15, 19-30), which
 illustrate the general doctrines that underlie the whole. There is,
 too, a certain simplicity and directness in the language, though there
 is, of course, no attempt to come down to the level of the steward’s
 comprehension. j ἱ

 Of the date of this Epistle it can only be said that it was written
 after 23, when Antonius Musa introduced the cold-water cure, and per-
 haps in fulﬁlment of the intention expressed in Epist. 1, 7, 11, to spend
 a winter on the southern coast. The person addressed is a Numonius
 Vala, of whom, individually, nothing is known except what is implied
 in the letter. But there are references in inscriptions and on coins to
 Numonii, who were of a somewhat distinguished family in Lucania.

 ‘ Tell me all about your part of the country, Vala (for my doctor has
 ordered me to give up Baiae and take to the cold-water business; I
 don’t like it, but I suppose I must do as he says); how about the
 bread? and the water? (I’ll attend to the wine myself.) And what
 can I get in the way of game and sea food? Oh, yes, I haven’t for-
 gotten my own sermons. But you know the story of Maenius, how he
 used to preach against prodigals, but, when he had a chance, used to
 return with gusto to his prodigal life again. So I preach simplicity
 when my bank account is low, but I also know a good dinner when I
 see it.’

 But the dry questions are interrupted by humorous parentheses which
 explain the reason for the letter and set forth the cheerful frame of mind

 scurra, which is deﬁned by Plautus

 suggestion of dispamgement, but
 in combination with urbanus,
 which inclines toward a good

 need the deﬁnition of the two

 —vagus: not a regular convictor
 at any house, but picking up an

 praese‘pe: crib, manger, used hu-

 The year in which this Epistle was written cannot be determined,
 and the character of the letter is such that the precise date is not in:-
 portant. It may perhaps be inferred from vs. 16 that it was written in
 the late summer or the early autumn. The Quinctius to whom the letter
 is addressed is a man of position in public life (vss. 17-18), of some
 experience (vs. 25), and perhaps in ofﬁce at this time (vs. 34). He
 may be the Quinctius Hirpinus of Carm. 2, II.

 ‘My farm, if you care to know about it, my dear Quinctius, is not so
 much a source of revenue to me, as a source of pleasure and health.
 Mountains, woods, streams, and a cool spring make it a perfect retreat
 from the heats of the city.

 ‘As for you, you are in the midst of the active struggle of life, where
 reputation seems more important than character. But we must not be
 misled by popular applause, for it is often insincere and always ﬁckle.
 Reputation may be taken away; character is our own. But it must be
 true virtue, not the fear of consequences, that keeps us from doing

 EPISTVLAE [r , 16, 4

 wrong. We must not be the slaves of our desires, but must stand
 independent and free from fear. Death itself, the ultimate penalty,
 comes alike to all.’

 This Epistle belongs ‘to the more impersonal class of the letters, like
 1, 6 and I, ιο. There is some degree of personality in the ﬁrst part,
 vss. 1—16; Horace cannot write impersonally of his Sabine farm. And
 vss. 17-18 have undoubtedly some special reference to the circumstances
 of Quinctius. But the latter part of the Epistle is general, a sort of
 restatement, in Horaee’s words and manner, of the second Stoic Para-
 dox. This is quoted by Cicero (Parad. 2) z ὅτι αὐτάρκης ἦ ἀρετὴ πρὸς
 εὐδαιμονίαν, in quo sit virtus, ei nihil deesse ad beate vivendum, and is
 dismissed and illustrated by him somewhat as it is here treated by Horace,
 with allusions to popular favor, to the tyranny of the passions, and to
 death as the ultima linea. In the style, also, as well as in the sub-
 stance, there is an adoption of Stoic teaching by means of short sen-
 tences and lively bits of dialogue. No careful reader of the Satires
 will be surprised to ﬁnd that Horace, in his later study of philosophy,
 sometimes accepts the Stoic doctrines ; even in the earlier writings it
 is possible to see, underneath the ﬂippancy with which he meets the
 formalism of the Stoics, a considerable measure of sympathy with the
 essence of their teaching. ”

 method of presenting an argument,

 the Scholiast to be taken from a

 The person to'whorn this Epistle is addressed is wholly unknown,
 nor is there anything in the letter to ﬁx the date.

 ‘I know that you need no advice about living with the great, yet per-
 haps I may be able to say something about it that you will care to hear.
 If you prefer a retired life, you can ﬁnd happiness there, but if you seek
 for something more, you must go where it is to be found. You know
 the story of Diogenes and Aristippus; the one prided himself upon his
 rudeness, the other was a man of the world. It was the latter who was
 truly a philosopher, for if it is a worthy ambition to desire to be dis-
 tinguished in public life, then it is also a worthy ambition to desire to
 please the men who are thus distinguished. To refuse to make the
 attempt is a kind of cowardice; to enter the contest and win a place is
 honorable.

 ⁴ But I don’t mean that one should be a beggar, always parading his
 needs and his misfortunes. The Egyptian humbug, pretending to have
 broken his leg in order to excite pity, fools only the inexperienced.’

 There is scarcely anything of the epistolary form or tone in this
 letter. It is a discourse, partly serious, but largely ironical, on the
 proper attitude toward men of higher rank. This was a subject which
 Horace had himself been obliged to consider with serious attention.
 His relation to Maecenas and Augustus and Agrippa had exposed him
 to criticism and had been in itself difﬁcult to reconcile with that inde-
 pendence of life and thought which he desired to maintain. It was
 impossible for him to write on this subject without a consciousness,
 which reveals itself in several places, of his own personal interest in it.
 To some extent, therefore, it is seriously meant; the attitude and teach-
 ing of Aristippus in regard to social relations command Horace‘s ap-
 proval. On the other hand, the relation of the man of humbler rank
 to the greater men is almost everywhere treated as though the ultimate

 object of it was proﬁt, not real friendship. This is, of course, ironica),
 and at the close, from vs. 43 to the end, it becomes pure satire.

 It is certainly difﬁcult for the modern reader, accustomed to demo-
 cratic ideals, to estimate this Epistle quite justly, not taking it too

 seriously and yet not overlooking the serious meaning.

 For a full

 understanding of Horace’s attitude on this subject, this Epistle should
 be_ compared with the next and both should be read in connection with

 Epist. I, 7, to Maecenas.

 Quamvis, Scaeva, satis per te tibi consulis, et scis

 This Epistle was written in the year 20 B.C., as the reference to the
 recovery of Roman standards from the Parthians (vss. 56 f.) shows,
 and is addressed to the Lollius to whom Epist. 1, 2 was written.

 ‘Lack of independence is a fault to be avoided, my dear Lollius, in
 your relation to a man of rank, but lack of common sense is worse.
 The true course lies between. The lack of self-respect makes a man a
 mere parasite; lack of judgment makes him assert his independence by
 wrangling about triﬂes.

 ‘ Do not try to rival your patron in extravagance; he will not like you
 the better for it, and you cannot aﬁ'ord it. The ill-natured witticism of
 Volumnius, that the best way to ruin a man was to give him a ﬁne coat
 and let him try to live up to it, has enough of truth in it to serve as a
 warning. Do not try. to learn his secrets and don’t betray his conﬁ-
 dences. Don‘t insist on following your own inclinations, even though
 they may seem to you the better; Amphion, you know, gave up the
 lyre to please his brother. If your friend likes hunting better than
 poetry, yield and go with him. It will do you good and you are an
 athlete; I have seen you on the Campus and I remember that sea ﬁght
 on your father’s estate. Be careful in your speech and in your conduct.
 Introduce only men that you know well, and if you make a mistake in
 this, don’t refuse to acknowledge it. But stand by your true friends, as
 you expect them to stand by you. And conform even to your patron’s
 moods; be serious when he is serious, and gay when he is gay, and
 keep a cheerful countenance at all times.

 ‘ But above all ﬁx your mind upon the lessons and ideals of philosophy
 and learn from them the secret of a peaceful life.

 ‘As for me‚I have attained to that peaceful life. [ask of the gods
 nothing but a continuance of it.’

 This Epistle deals, in substance, with a situation like that which is
 discussed in the Epistle immediately preceding, but with great differ-
 ences both in form and in tone. The epistolary form is maintained
 with much skill; there are many personal touches, so that the character
 and situation of the young Lollius are clearly deﬁned and the unnamed
 patron is more than a lay ﬁgure. And the letter closes with a passage
 of peculiarly intimate self-disclosure. All this is much superior to the
 essay form of Epist. I, [7. In the tone, also, there is more of reality.
 Here, even more distinctly than in the letter to Scaeva, Horace had
 constantly in mind his own relation to Maecenas and his own efforts
 to ﬁnd the middle course between an undue deference and an unwise

 course, under the guise of advice to a younger friend, with a sense of

 satisfaction.

 ‘live up to’ these he would work
 out his own destruction. But it

 This Epistle was written just before the publication of the collection,
 in the year 20 n.c. It is ﬁtly addressed, like 5pm. 1, 1, to Maecenas,
 as the most cordial and intimate of the poet’s friends and admirers.

 ‘ There is an old idea that poets should drink wine. Cratinus held
 this, and Homer and Ennius, too, and I once laid down the same doc-
 trine. Since then my contemporaries have reeked of wine, as if one
 could become a Cato by wearing a toga like his. Imitation of eccen-
 tricities is not very laudable, nor, in fact, is any kind of imitation.
 From that fault I have kept myself free. Archilochus was my leader in
 the Epodes, but I followed him exactly as Alcaeus and Sappho did,
 learning from him the lyric art, but using it for other purposes than
 his. So also I followed Alcaeus and Sappho in turn in the Odes, and
 I claim with pride, as I said at the time when the Odes were published,
 to have been the ﬁrst of Romans to carry on the tradition of the lyric
 ,poetry of Lesbos.

 ‘If you ask why my poetry has not won greater applause, I mn easily
 answer the question ; it is because l have not sought for the favor of

 123

 critics and cliques. And when I say that I cannot venture to submit
 my trifles to their learned judgment, they accuse me of laughing at
 them. The result is that I don’t dare to show any contempt at all; I
 back out of the contest; they might be the death of me, if they knew
 what I really think of them.’

 Under the form of an Epistle to Maecenas Horace is here defending
 his Odes against the critics, as in his earlier career he had defended
 himself in Sat. 3, 4 and Sat. 3, ιο and had made sport of his detractors
 in Sat. 2, 3. Of the occasion for such replies we know little except by
 inference. Vergil, highly as he was honored during his lifetime, was
 also severly criticized, so that his friends felt called upon to defend him.
 That Horace should have been the object of similar attacks, made all
 the more bitter by his intimacy with Maecenas, is altogether natural.
 With respect to the Odes, published in 23 B.C., the criticism took the
 form of a charge of lack of originality. To this Horace replies, ﬁrst by
 a kind of deﬁnition of servile imitation, and then by a statement of his
 real relation to the Greek lyric poets. He stood, he says, in precisely
 the same relation to Alcaeus and Sappho in which they stood to Archilo-
 chus; he was an artist of the same school, not an imitator. This is,
 of course, the true explanation of the relation of any poet or artist to
 his predecessors; a proper understanding of it would have saved
 modern critics from repeating the statement that Latin literature is
 imitative.

 ι. prisco . . . Cratinoz one of
 the poets of the Old Comedy men-
 tioned in Sat. 3, 4, 1. The adj.
 priscus is used because it was the
 technical rhetorical term for the

 ferred to and had become tradi-
 tional. —docte: so of Maecenas,
 Carm. 3, 8, 5, docte sermones utri-
 usque linguac5 his acquaintance
 with literature would have made the
 sayings of Cratinus familiar to him.

 2—3. This precise sentiment is
 not found in any of the fragments
 of the plays of Cratinus. It is,
 however, merely a lively expression
 of the praise of wine which is fre»
 quent in all literature; cf. Carm.
 3, 18, 3, siccis omnia nam dura

 4. adscripsit. . . Satyrist ‘added

 with his satyrs.’ This is not a
 reference to some deﬁnite myth,
 but only 3 humorous way of saying
 ‘ from the beginnings of poetry.’

 from the fumes of the night’s
 drinking.

 6. laudibus: they are merelythe
 traditional praises, 3 line here and

 accused of being.’

 7. Ennius: there was a tradi-
 tion that he had gout, based per-
 haps upon a line from one of his
 saturae (numquam poetar nisi si
 podager) the form of which seems
 to have been in Horace’s mind.

 8. prosiluit: he sprang forward
 like one of the ﬁghters he de-
 scribed-puteal Libonis: a spot
 in the Forum which had been

 struck by lightning and therefore,
 as sacred, surrounded by a low
 wall. lt is said by the Scholiast to
 have been the place where the
 praetor held court. The sense
 would then be, ‘business and pub-

 drinkers.’

 used of the edict of the praetor. -—-

 be certare, but putere is substituted
 ironically—The sentence con-
 tinues the previous course of
 thought; ‘Cratinus taught that
 poets should be drinkers; so, it is
 said, did Homer and Ennius, and
 when Bacchus enrolled poets
 among his followers, the very
 Muses took to hard drinking. Now
 it is my turn; when I sang the

 with the meaning of the corre-
 sponding English word, but ‘ bring

 15—16. The point of the allusion
 is that Iarbitas tried to rival Tima-
 genes in rhetorical skill, but suc-
 ceeded only in imitating his fault
 of bitterness. This is the same as
 the point of vss. 32-34, that one
 cannot acquire the character of
 Cato by imitating his eccentrici-
 ties, and the two illustrations are
 summed up in vs. 17. Timagenes
 was a Greek rhetorician of consid-
 erable ability (urbanus, disertus),
 who fell into disgrace because of
 the bitterness of his wit. Iarbitas
 is perhaps the nickname of a cer-
 tain Cordus, who may be the Co-
 drus referred to by Vergil, Ecl. 7,
 26, invtdia rumpantur ut ilia

 Codro. But the allusion must re-
 main obscure in its details, though
 the general sense is clear.—rupit:
 a reference to the fable of the Ox
 and the Frog, to which Horace
 alludes also in Sat. 2, 3, 314 ﬂ'.
 The Scholiast, however, takes it
 literally. —Timagenis: gen. after

 bus corresponds to res, and vss.
 30-31 expand agentia verba Ly-
 camben. This makes complete
 the parallel between Horace and
 the two Greek lyric poets; he has
 done exactly what Alcaeus and
 Sappho did. To this parallelism
 he makes a slight exception in
 ordine, because he recognizes fully
 in the Odes the claim of Alcaeus
 and Sappho to be considered the
 originators of the two strophes
 which bear their names.

 An Epilogue to the collection of Epistles, written in the year 20, after
 the other poems were collected for publication.

 ‘ You are eager to see the world, my book, like a young slave who
 seeks to escape from the house of a good master. Go, then, and meet
 your fate; you will, I think, have some readers, but I do not predict for
 you an immortality of favor.

 ‘ While the favor lasts, tell your readers what I am, a freedman’s son
 who feels himself now coming to middle age.’

 This poem is, on the one side, an expression of the writer’s hopes
 and fears, as he sends a new book out into the world. It is done, as
 one would expect from Horace, without ﬂourish of trumpets; he is
 quite aware of the fact that the book has merits, but he knows also that
 it is not the greatest book that was ever written. On this side the
 poem might be compared with Catullus‘s address to his new book, with
 Ovid’s Tristia 3, 1 and Martial, I, 3. On the other side, this epistle is
 like the biographies which were often appended to standard editions,
 much as the Vita by Suetonius is preserved in the Mss. of Horaoe‘s
 complete works. The brief ‘Life’ of the author gives his birth and
 origin (2ο), his rise in life (21-23), his appearance and character

 (24-25), and his age (26—28), as such things are given in biographies ‚

 of the standard form. Propertius (3, 22) and Ovid (Amor. 3, l 5) have
 followed the same custom.

 LIBER SECVNDVS

 I

 The date of this Epistle can be determined with a fair degree of pre-
 cision. It is probable that Horace wrote it, in accordance with the
 custom which he had followed in publishing other collections of poems,
 after the other Epistles, 2 and 3 (the Ars Poctica), to serve as an intro-
 duction and to dedicate the whole collection to the person addressed in
 this letter. This general probability is supported by a passage in the
 Vita of Suetonius: ‘post sermones vero quosdam lectos nullam sui
 mentionem habitam ita sit questus: “ irasci me tibi scito, quod non in
 plerisque eius modi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. An vereris ne
 Δ apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse?”
 3‘ expresseritque eclogam ad se cuius initium est cum tot sustineas . . . .’
 This story comes immediately after a reference to the Carmen Saecu-
 lare and the Fourth Book of the Odes. The sermones quosdam and
 the eius modi scrzptis cannot have been the Satires, published ﬁfteen
 years earlier, and can scarcely have been the First Book of the Epistles,
 which had been before the public for some years. These words must
 therefore refer to Epist. 2, 2 and 3, already known to Augustus before
 they were formally published. All this falls into proper sequence with
 the references to the campaigns of 15-14 B.C., referred to in vss. 252-
 2 53, and points to 14 or I 3 n.c. as the date of composition.

 The course of thought is natural and easy, shifting from one aspect
 of the subject to another without following a formal scheme. Some
 general divisions will be noticed: vss. 5—92, the overestimate of early
 writers in comparison with new poetry; 93-117, the historical develop-
 ment which has resulted in the present situation; 118-138, the contri-
 butions of the poet to the welfare of society; 139-213, the special
 disadvantages and defects of dramatic writing; 214-250, the good inﬂu-
 ence of the patronage of Augustus upon literature; 250—-270, Horace’s
 own relation to the patronage of Augustus.

 In the Second Book of the Epistles the form of versiﬁed letter is
 somewhat changed. The three Epistles are all long and their very
 length destroys the illusion of the letter form; they-necessarily become
 essays, addressed, it is true, to an individual, but intended for the public

 134

 l EPISTVLAE [2, 1, 2

 In this Epistle the personal tone is also subdued by the fact that it
 was addressed to the Emperor. The opening lines, therefore, though
 they are concerned entirely with the personal aspect and not at all with
 the subject of the letter, are distinctly and quite properly formal. The
 close, from vs. 250 to the end, is also personal, having to do with
 Horace‘s own relation to literature and to Augustus, and here there is
 a lighter tone, especially from vs. 264 to the end. At other points, too,
 as in 214 Εἰ, there is a certain measure of appeal to Augustus to use his
 inﬂuence for the good of literature. In general, however, Horace has

 , not made any very serious effort to preserve the illusion of a letter.

 On the other hand, this is not a formal essay; it is rather the un-
 studied comment of a veteran man of letters upon the condition and
 prospects of the literature of his time. The particular subjects selected
 for comment or criticism are not indeed limited to Horace’s own experi-
 ence, but they are in part suggested by it. The whole of the ﬁrst third
 of the Epistle is a protest against the over-valuation of the early Latin
 poetry and a defense of living writers, including Horace himself, against
 the disposition to undervalue the present. This is, in some sense, a
 continuation of the argument of Sat. r, 4; r, 10; 2, r, and Epict. 1, 19,
 but it would be pressing it too far to ﬁnd in it the motive of the whole
 letter. In other parts, in 118-338, in 139 ΗΖ, Horace is writing as a
 student of literary history, selecting such portions of the rhetorical
 tradition as suited his purpose and using them to illustrate and deﬁne
 the situation of his time.

 This Epistle deserves most careful reading. Much of the subject-
 matter, it is true, has no immediate relation to modern conditions,
 though the comments upon the stage are ‘an exception and might
 have been written for a magazine in this century. The literary history,
 also, must be taken with much reserve; it is only the current teaching
 of the scholar and is in many points quite incorrect. But the easy turn
 of the thought, the mastery of happy expression, the humor and the

 occasional satire, all show that Horace came toward the close of life l,

 with ripening powers-integra cum mente, as he had wished.

 this repeats the
 thought of vs. 9 and leads on to
 the main theme, the invidia which
 poets encountered. Strictly, the
 word is not in place in the story of
 Hercules—supremo ﬁne : i.e., ‘only
 by death,’ ‘ not until after his death.’

 13-14. nrit: transferred from

 ³ physical pain to the suffering

 of emotion. Here the physical
 sense is to dank, blind, as fulgore
 shows. — praegravat: literally,
 mag/i: down,⁶ to be interpreted
 with infra se positas.- artes:
 faulen, almost the same as
 virtutem-The whole expression
 is difﬁcult of analysis, ﬁrst, bemuse
 two different ﬁgures are used in
 urit and praegravat, and, second,
 because of the mixture of the con-
 crete (qui, extinctus, amabitur)
 and the abstract (praegravat,
 artes). The underlying sense is
 ‘he who is superior to others in
 his powers and who thus makes
 others feel their inferiority, excites
 envy by his greatness.’—ama-

 bitur: ‘but after his death his
 virtues are recognized.’

 true, recognition has come during
 your lifetime.’ - mturoa: i.c.,
 ⁴ before it was too late.’

 ιο. nument an unofﬁcial deiﬁ-
 cation of Augustus began early
 (29 n.c.) in the provinces and
 was then taken up in some parts
 of 'Italy. *But the only formal
 recognition of this in Rome was a
 cult of the genius Augusti, with
 altars where oaths could be taken.
 The complete deiﬁcation was not
 until after the death of Augustus,
 who during his lifetime dis-
 couraged these extravagances.

 present merit is by no means ex-
 tended to poets and poetry.’—

 Gabii, written in archaic letters
 on bull’s hide, was still in existence
 in the time of Dionysius of Hali-
 carnassus, in Horace’s time. Cf.
 Livy, 1, 54. Several treaties with
 the Sabines were preserved.—
 aequata: ratzﬁed. The implication
 that they were ‘ on equal terms’ is
 merely conventional.

 26. pontiﬂcum libros: the rec-
 ords of rituals and of events of

 dictitet Albano Musas in morﬁt‘e‘ﬂlocutas;L

 religious signiﬁcance, dating back
 to the earliest use of writing in
 Rome. — volumina : prophecies
 and oracles, written in some of
 the early verse forms like the Sa-

 turnian. Livy mentions in 25, 12

 certain carmina which foretold
 the battle of Cannae.

 27. dictitet: the subject is still
 populus. -Albano . . . in monte:
 one of the most sacred spots in
 early Roman worship; if the
 Muses transferred their home from
 Greece to Italy, as such opinions ⁶
 would seem to imply, then the
 Alban Mount would become their
 Helicon.—Musas . . . locutas: this
 seems to be a reminiscence of the
 phrase of Aelius Stilo and Varro,
 quoted by Quint. ιο, 1, 99, ‘Mu-
 sas Plautino sermone locuturas
 fuisse, si Latine loqui vellent)-
 Though these early records are
 lost, there are fragments enough
 to show that they were composed
 in an· extremely formal and
 cramped style, that they were, in
 fact, not literature at all. Horace
 is using extreme examples to lay
 a foundation for his argument

 28-33. ‘The fact that the old-
 est Greek writers are the besf
 does not prove that the same
 thing is true in Latin literature.’

 28. Graiomm= the more poetic
 word. In the Satires Horace pre-
 fers Graecus3 but the distinction
 is not sharply made, cf. vs. 90,
 below.

 29. optima: Horace is thinking
 in a general way of the fact that
 Greek literature begins with Ho-
 mer; he is not following out the
 argument into details, like the com-
 parison of the merits of Archilo-
 chus and Alcaeus, and he is not
 thinking at all of the place of
 tragedy. I

 3o. trutina =. cf. the similar use
 of this ﬁgure in Sat. 1, 3, 72,
 where ponetur corresponds to
 panianum-non est quod: i.e.,
 ‘there is no more to be said,’ ‘it is
 an end of all rational argument,
 and we can prove anything.’

 31, intra, extra: adverbs. —
 olea: with in to be supplied from
 in ﬂute; cf. Gabiis, vs. 25. —-duri:

 with nil. ‘The same kind of ar-
 gument from analogy would prove
 that as a nut is hard outside and
 soft inside, so an olive must be
 the same.’

 32—33. ‘By the same reasoning,
 as we have become masters of the
 world, we must be masters of the
 Greeks in all the arts.’ This is
 another illustration, beside that
 of vs. 31, of the absurdities to
 which the argument of 28-29
 would lead-pingimus, psalli-
 mus, luctamur: literature, paint-
 ing and sculpture, music, and
 gymnastics are the four liberal
 arts on which Greek edumtion
 was based.-unctis= with refer-
 ence only to the last mentioned
 art, luctamur.

 34-49. A new argument; ‘the
 measurement of poetry by its
 antiquity is absurd, because the
 standard is shifting. How many
 years are required to make a
 writer old ?’

 34. dies: time; cf. Carm. 3, 6,

 centum was of course suggested as
 a round number; but Horace prob-
 ably noticed the fact that this limit
 would exclude from the veteres

 highly praised by the admirers of
 the early literature. He died in 103
 B.C., and would therefore fall short
 of the time by only a few years.

 45-47. The argument called So-
 ritcs, the argument of the ‘falling
 heap.‘ Given a suﬁicient amount
 of grain to be called a heap
 (σωρός), will it still be a heap if
 one grain is taken away? And at
 what point, if one still continues
 to take away a grain at a time, will
 it cease to be a heap? Another
 form of the argument was to ask
 how many hairs may be lost before
 a man can fairly be called bald
 (donumdei-peruium the oon-
 cession. in vss. 43-44.—caudu
 . . . equinam this is either a con-
 fusion of the argument of the
 φαλακρός with a story about the
 pulling out of the hairs from a
 horse’s tail one at a time, to show
 what may be accomplished by
 patience (Val. Max. 7, 3, 6), or it
 is some variant of the argument,
 unknown to us. —ratione: the

 praise used also by Horace of Lu-

 with reference to his descriptions

 by Lucilius and expressed with
 exaggeration the prevalent atti-

 5:. leviter curate: ‘to care but
 little,’ ‘to be indifferent)

 52. quo . . . cadant: ‘ how they
 turn out.’—somnia: in the be-
 ginning of the Annales Ennius
 told how Homer had come to him
 in a dream and had said that
 Ennius was a reincarnation of

 Homer himself, according to the
 doctrine of the transmigration of
 souls, taught by Pythagoras.—
 These lines about Ennius give the
 critical estimate of students of the
 early literature like Varro, but
 with touches of irony, especially in
 leviter curare videtur; ‘ he is so
 securely established that he does
 not need to care—and in fact
 does not (are—whether his per-
 formance equals his promise or
 not.’

 53-54. Naevius: died in 204;
 writer of comedies and especially,
 in this connection, the ﬁrst of
 Roman epic poets. His Bellum
 Punicum in Saturnian verse was
 supplanted by the Annals of
 Ennius, as that in turn gave way
 to the Aeneid—pane recens:
 i.e., ‘ we read him almost as if his
 works were still new,’ a little hit at
 the critics, who, in spite of their
 praise of the old, are as eager as
 any one to read the last thing that
 has appeared.

 and grammar-lam; they arranged

 died in x 32, one of the great tragic
 writers. -Acciusz died in 104,
 also a writer of tragedies. The
 judgment here expressed was the
 traditional judgment and is re-
 peated by Quintil. 10, 1, 77.
 57-59. Four comic poets, with

 ’ the conventional estimate of each.

 Afranius, a contemporary of
 Accius, wrote oomedies on Ro-
 man subjects, called by gram-
 marians fabulae togatae, but in the
 manner of the Greek New Comedy.
 He is said to have used material
 from Menander, and this is* ex·
 pressed in toga convenisse. Plautus
 (died in 184), the representative of
 the fabula palliata, comedy in
 which the actors wore the Greek
 pallium. His excellence was held
 to be in the quick and easy move-
 ment ( propcrarc) of his dialogue,
 in which he was thought to equal
 Epicharmus, a Sicilian writer of
 comedy. The general form of

 expression pairs Afranius and
 Plautus off together, though in fact

 Plautus should be classed with the ·

 two following writers. Caeciliu§-
 (died about 168) was sometimes
 considered the greatest of the
 writers of the fabula palliata.
 Terentius (died in 160) was the
 last of the greater writers in this
 style. Of all these poets only the
 works of Plautus (twenty plays)
 and Terence (six plays) are pre-
 served; the rest are in rather
 scanty fragments.

 σο. arto= so crowded that it
 seemed small.

 61. potens: ironically, like veni·

 62. Livi: Livius Andronicus,
 the earliest of Latin writers, with
 whose production of a play, in
 240 B.C., Latin literature was
 thought to have begun.

 back from the judgment of critics
 to the popular opinion, connecting

 ceremonies, e.g., Livy, 27, 37; 31,
 12, and they probably formed a
 part of some of the annually recur-

 a song to Diana and Apollo, and
 Catull. 34 to Diana. The function

 139-155. A history of the rise
 of poetry in Italy, before the com-
 ing in of the Greek inﬂuence, lead-
 ing up to a critiml estimate of it.
 This history is not, however, based
 upon any knowledge of the devel-
 , opment of Italian poetry before
 Livius Andronicus. That develop-
 ment, whatever it may have been,
 had passed entirely unrecorded.
 The account which Horace here
 givs and the corresponding ac-
 count in Livy 7, 2 are based upon
 some Greek rhetorical tradition,
 adapted to embrace the few facts
 which were known by inference or
 tradition, like the versus Fescen-
 nini (145) and the lex of the
 Twelve Tables (152 f.).

 139. fortes parvoque beati: i.e.,
 simple and happy, as in a Golden
 Age, when song might, as it was
 thought, originate.

 140. condita: the harvest-home
 festival.

 x41. ipsum animum: and even
 their spirits. -ferentemz ι”.ε.,
 which had borne hardship up to
 this time.

 142. pueris: as Ofellus (Sat. 2,
 2, 115) labors in the ﬁelds with

 his sons.——ooniuge: so Epod. 2,
 39 iii—These are details of the
 ideal life of the farmer, cultivat-
 ing his own ﬁelds with the help of
 his family, not working on the great
 estate of an absentee landlord.

 143. Tellurem: mentioned by
 Varro (R. R. 1, 3, 4) as one of the
 gods to be worshiped by farmers.
 —-Silva.num: called tutor ﬁm‘um
 in Epod. 2, 22.

 x44. Genium: aprotectingspirit,
 born to each human being and
 accompanying him through life
 to the end, sharing his pleas-
 ures and sorrows. Offerings
 were made to the Genius, as to a
 divinity, yet he was mortal and
 therefore memorem brevis aevi,
 like the man himself.

 145. Fescennina . . . iicentia=
 the Fescennine verses survived in
 historic times in the form of abu-
 sive songs sung at weddings and in
 triumphal processions, apparently

 *to avert the jealousy of the gods,

 which might be awakened by the
 felicity of the bridegroom or of the
 successful general. A modiﬁed
 specimen is given in Catullus, 61,
 119 ff. Horace here treats the

 having been invented for use in
 rustic festivals (per hunc morem),
 and regards the abusive quality of

 x46. versibus alternis: Livy, 7,

 the singers are supposed to have
 extemporized in turn, somewhat
 as in the songs in the Eclogues, 3
 and 7.

 147. libertasz i.e., the licentia

 ancing inventa. Livy uses this
 - word also.

 148. ambiliter: i.e., the oppro-

 by the rods of the lictors.

 most frequently quoted phrases.

 157. agrestiz referring back to
 vss. 139 ff. - The whole state‹

 :58. numerus Saturuius: of this
 old Italian meter many specimens
 are extant. It was the national
 verse until it was displaced by the
 hexameter. The earliest epic,
 the Bellum Punicum of Naevius,

 . was in Saturnians. Its irregulari-

 ties justify the adj. horridus.
 - grave virus: i.e., the roughness
 was like an unpleasant liquid, op-
 pressive to the senses.

 160. vestigia ruris : ‘ of the prim-
 itive rudeness of rustic Latium.’
 — This is the point of the argu-
 ment; ‘the early writers, whom
 critics extol so highly, were in
 fact only partially affected by
 Greek influence, while we of the
 present time have more perfectly
 learned Greek technique.’ It is not

 _to be expected that Horace should

 share the modern view, which ﬁnds
 so much of interest in the origins
 and primitive forms of art. ’

 his, utile ferrent.

 162. post Punica bella: these
 words could not be used with ref-
 erence to the First Punic War only.
 We are obliged therefore to sup-
 pose that Horace was following an
 erroneous chronology, of which
 there are traces in other authors,
 which made Livius Andronicus a
 contemporary of Ennius. — The
 thought here corresponds to vs. 93,
 positis . . . Graecia bellis; the
 peace which succeeded a great
 war gave opportunity for the culti-
 vation of literature.

 :63. Thespis: traditionally the
 founder of the tragic drama; cf.
 A. P. 276. The chronological
 order is not observed. — utile:
 there is perhaps a touch of the
 Roman attitude in the use of this
 word.

 :64. tentavit rem: made tlte
 attempt. - vertere: used as a
 technical term of translating or
 adapting a Greek play.

 165-366. placuit sibi= 112., ‘the
 attempt was successful’; the
 phrase does not at all imply ‘self-
 satisfaction,’ as the context shows.

 restriction of vs. 167.—sublimis
 et sect: of Iaﬂy spirit,- this is the
 same as the acer spiritus ac vis of
 Sat. 1, 4, 46. - spirat tragicum=
 this ﬁgure is especially poetic; it
 appears in various forms, spirare
 bellum, quietem, amores (Carm.
 4, 13, 19), praelia, magnum, mai-
 ora, and has been taken over into
 English. — satis: with feliciter.
 - feliciter audet= of the style, as
 spirat is of the spirit. -These
 opinions in regard to the ﬁtness
 of Roman character to .tragedy
 are justiﬁed by the facts. There
 was no lack of the lofty and the
 heroic. But the production of
 great tragedy requires a very high
 esthetic and constructive imagi-
 nation, in which the Romans were
 lacking.

 :67. This was a favorite doc-
 trine with Horace (cf. Sat. 1, ιο,
 67-72; A. P. 290) and a natural
 . one in the Augustan Age, when
 the efforts of writers in prose and
 in verse were directed most ear-
 nestly toward perfection of style.
 02, e.g.‚ what is said in the Vita
 of Donatus about Vergil‘s methods
 of work.

 168. ex medio: from ordinary

 life, in distinction from the myth-'
 ical and heroic world from which
 tragedy takes its subjects (res).
 x7o. plus oneris: merely another
 ﬁgure for plus sudoris,· the labor
 of writing weil is like a burden
 under which the bearet· sweats.
 —veniae minus: i.e., it is less easy
 to win a favorable judgment in
 comedy than in tragedy, precisely
 because it deals with ordinary life,
 so that each bearer can judge for
 himself of the correctness of the
 picture. — Plautum the unfavor-
 able judgment here expressed is
 repeated, from a slightly different
 point of view, in A. P. 270 ff. It
 is not without justiﬁcation, but it is
 one-sided; the merits of Plautus
 as a writer of comedy were not of
 a kind to appeal to Horace.
 171-172. quo pacto: i.e., ‘how
 poorly.’ —tutetnr: ‘plays the
 part,’ transferred from the actor to
 the writer; the meaning is that the
 characters are not harmoniously
 and consistently drawn, as they
 are in the Greek originals and in
 Terence. The judgment rests
 upon too narrow a conception of
 art in comedy. -ephebi, patris,

 each are also traditional.

 173. Dossennus: a character in
 the fabula Atellam», resembling in
 general the parasite of Plautus.
 The sense of the line is not quite
 clear, but appears to be, ‘what a
 Dossennus he is in the part of the
 hungry parasite,’ i.e., *how much
 his parasites resemble the Dossen-
 nus οἱ popular farces, rather than
 the more artistic ﬁgure of the par-
 asite in the New Comedy.’

 374. non adstricto: ‘loosely
 tied,’ ‘ careless.’ This is a general
 expression, summarizing vss. r70—
 173.

 175-176. ‘For he was careless
 and negligent (vs. 167), interested
 only in the price he got for his
 play.’--post hoc: after he was
 paid. The leading actor (dominus
 gregis) was the agent of the giver
 of the games in buying the play

 Saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poetam,

 holding a place on the stage, but
 here brought back to its original
 meaning by recto talo, ‘stands

 :77. The thought turns from
 Plautus to the condition of the
 stage and dramatic writing.—
 Gloria:.cf. Sat. r, 6, 23, fuggente
 . . . Gloria curru.-ventoso= as
 ﬁckle as the wind; cf. Epist. x,
 39, 37, ventosae plebis.

 378-183. The same thought is
 here expressed three times; ﬁrst
 by exanimat (takes away his
 breath) and indat (causes him to
 take a full breath of self-satisfac-
 tion); second, by subruit and
 rejicit (of pulling down and rebuild-

 the ‘laughing philosopher’; the
 sense therefore is ‘here would

 rather thanrfor reproof.’

 195. The giraﬁ'e, cameloparda-
 lis, was supposed to be a cross
 between a camel and a panther
 (pard), and the confusion of
 expression here is intended to
 symbolize the mixture. The ex-
 pression is, in fact, so confused that
 it is not clear whether Horace
 means diversum genus to be an
 accus. with confusa (Sat. 1, 6, 74,
 suspensi loculos) or an appositive
 of panthera. ,The first giraffe seen

 minder of the Greek saying ὄνῳ
 τις ἔλεγε μῦθον· ὁ δὲ τὸ. ὦτα ἐκίνει,
 ⁴ a man told a story to an ass; the
 ass only shook his ears.’

 203. evaluere: more emphatic
 than aform of posse, and the per·
 fect tense, appealing to the facts
 of past experience, is more em-
 phatic in a sentence that impiies a
 negative, than the present tense
 would be; ‘no voices have ever
 had (or now have) power enough

 202. Gargnnum: the same illus-
 tration, from the noise of the
 wind in the oak forests of Garga-
 nus (a mountainous promontory

 from Horace’s early home) is used
 in Carm. 2, 9, 7, and references to

 252-253. These details evi-
 dently refer to campaigns in coun-

 impositas points to the campaigns
 of Drusus and Tiberius in the
 valleys of the Alps against the
 Vindelici, which were mrried on in
 15-14 B.C.‚ and which Horace had
 already celebrated in Carm. 4, 4
 and 14, at the request of Augustus.

 254. duella= the epic word. In
 these lines, as in the similar pas-

 in the very act of professing his
 Inability to write an epic, indulges

 Janus was closed by Augustus

 The subject matter of this Epistle is so general and there are so few
 allusions to public matters that the date cannot be ﬁxed with certainty.
 It is clear that so elaborate a renunciation of poetry cannot have been
 written during the period from 17 B.C. to 13 B.C., when Horace was
 writing the Carmen Saeculare and the Fourth Book of the Odes. There
 is nothing to show that it might not have been composed after 13 B.C.,
 but the general tone, in which it much resembles Epist. I, 1, and the

 163

 a. 2] HORATI

 difficulty of supposing that Horace twice publicly announced his inten-
 tion of giving up iyriml poetry, makes the earlier date, 20-18 n.c., more
 probable.

 For the young Julius Florus, see Introd. to Eptict. 1, 3. He was still
 in the suite of Tiberius and had apparently been long absent from
 Rome.

 ‘ Did you ever buy a slave, my dear Florus, and ﬁnd yourself pre-
 vented from'complaining of his faults by the ﬁct that the dealer had
 expressly mentioned them? Then you must not complain of not
 hearing from me, for I warned you that I never answer letters. And in
 spite of this, you call on me for more Odes ! Do you remember that
 story of the soldier of Lucullus? Some thief stole his savings and in a
 - rage he went οίῖ and stormed a cutie and got honor and more money.
 But when the general, with most ﬂattering words, invited him to lead
 another storming party, he declined with thanks and advised the gen-
 eral to get some other man who had just lost his purse. That is just
 my attitude. I lost my purse at Philippi and, in a rage, I stormed
 the castle of poetry. But once is enough ; I am taking my ease now.
 There are plenty of reasons for not writing. In the ﬁrst place, you all
 ask for different things. And then, how can one write in Rome, where “
 all is confusion P Nor, for another reason, do I like the mutual admira-
 tion clubs, which l should have to join. And it is no easy matter,
 ‚ either, to write really good poetry.

 ‘ The fact is that I have turned, as i said once before, from lyrics to
 philosophy, and am trying to learn the secrets of true living. I am con-
 sidering the nature of possession and how it differs from use and how
 transient it is, at the best. I am trying to practice ’the doctrine of the
 Golden Mean and to become both better and happier, as I grow
 older.‘

 In this Epistle, as in Eszvt. 2, 1, the letter form is used at the be-
 ginning with considerable skill, and something of the personal tone is
 maintained for perhaps ﬁfty lines. But from that point the epistle be-
 comes a versiﬁed essay, ﬁrst, on the writing of poetry and, second,
 on philosophy. The latter part contains nothing that Horace had
 not said before, though it is here expressed in new forms, but the
 strictures upon the state of literature in Rome are always interesting.
 The humorous opening of the Epistle, the bit of autobiography, and
 the veiled allusion to Propertius are perhaps the best parts of the
 letter. As a whole it is scarcely equal to the other Epistles of this
 Book.

 the city, by way of saying ‘clear

 81-86. ‘ Study and the writing
 of poetry are incompatible with
 the excitements and confusions of

 ably the most admired form of
 poetry. Horace did not himself
 attempt it. The allusion here is
 almost certainly to the elegiae poet
 Propertius. He was a member of
 the Maecenas circle, yet he is no-
 where mentioned by Horace, who
 mentions so many literary friends.
 The suspicion that this silence cov-
 ers some hostility is strengthened
 by the great differences in tempera-
 ment and in literary ideals. Com-
 mentators have therefore found
 veiled allusions to Propertius in
 various passages (Sat. 1, ιο, 18,
 simius iste,· Sat. 1, 9) ; this is the
 most distinct and probable.

 92. caelatum: the poem is
 praised in terms which would be
 used of a highly ornamented work
 of art. -novem Musis: dat. of

 ιοο. Callimachum Propertius
 (ς, 1, 64) calls himself the Ro-

 He was regarded as one of the

 i.e., ⁴ when the

 Catullus translated one of his

 i.e., ‘which before I had been
 v obliged to keep open.’ — impune:
 with obturem.

 106-128. Besides all the rea-
 sons already given for not writing
 poetry, there is the further reason,
 the most serious of all, that the
 work demands the utmost effort
 and the best powers. ‘Some
 poets, it is true, ﬁnd pleasure in
 composing, without regard to the
 quality of the product, but the
 poet of high ideals is his own
 severest critic.’

 107. gaudent scribentes: ‘are
 full of joy in their writing.’ The
 best parallel to these verses is
 Catull. 22, on Suffenus ; nequeidem
 umquam | aeque est beatus ac

 go on themselves to praise their
 writings.’ —beati: with laudant.

 109. legitimum= i.e., ‘a poem .

 according to the rules of the art
 of poetry.’ .

 110. cum tabulis: ‘when he
 takes up his tablets to begin writ-
 ing.’ The tabulae were used for
 a ﬁrst draft, because erasure and
 change were easy in the waxen
 surface. The expression partly

 anticipates the following compar-
 ison of the critic to the censor;
 ‘the poet, when he takes up his
 tablets to write, will feel as the
 censor does when he takes up the

 -lists.’ —honestiz deﬁning censorii

 by a predicate addition; ‘ with all
 its strictness.’ The thought is
 then further ampliﬁed in audebit.

 The next lines deal almost en·
 tirely with that part of the poet’s
 work which has to do with the
 selection of digniﬁed and ex-
 pressive words. This was a sub·

 much thought, and, while he is

 114. The expression here is
 selected almost entirely with the
 thought of the censor’s work in
 mind; ‘although they may have
 been hitherto at home in the most
 sacred spot in Rome,’ ‘although
 they may have had thus far a per-
 fect reputation.’ With reference
 to words it means ‘although they
 have been used ln the ﬁnest of
 poetry.’ The identification of the
 object compared with the ﬁgure
 results in some lack of clearness.

 u7. Catonibus, Cethegis: the

 Cethegus.’ They are again used
 in A. P. 50, 56 as representatives
 of the early Latin style. Cato was
 regarded by writers of archaizing
 tendencies, like Sallust, as a
 master of vigorous and individual
 style, and Cethegus (consul 204)
 is mentioned with praise by Cicero
 (Brut. r 5, 57) and was called by
 Ennius (Amt. 306) Suadae medul-
 la. It is not necessary, however,
 to attach to Horace’s use of these
 names any very speciﬁc meaning;
 they are types of the early orator.

 properly describes the result of

 poetic vocabulary by bringing back
 into use words which had fallen
 out was one of Vergil’s character-
 istic merits. Horace, from the
 nature of his subjects and the
 character of his lyric poetry, made
 fewer contributions of this kind.

 . . . uns: the doctrine that usage
 makes language, brings forward
 and maintains new words, was
 fully accepted by Horace and is
 expressed by him in a classic
 phrase (AP. 72), usus, quem
 penes arbitrium est et ius et norma
 loquendi.- This is the second
 means of enriching the living
 vocabulary. In the fragmentary
 condition of Latin literature it is
 not always possible to tell what
 writers ﬁrst adopted a new word
 into literary style, but Horace
 certainly made considerable use
 of this method of giving vividness
 and novelty to his forms of ex-
 pression.

 120. vemens, liquidus: these
 adjectives, though they go with
 the subject of beabit (z’.e., poeta),
 are really a part of the compar-
 ison.-puro . . . amnl: cf. for the
 opposite, cum flueret lutulentus,
 of Lucilius, in Sat. 1, 4, n. The

 121. fundet open: a rather gen-

 from the choice of words to the
 larger aspects of composition, fol-

 aspera . . . levabit= rhetoric paid
 much attention to the sound of
 words and phrases, as was natural
 when prose composition was largely
 occupied with oratory and when
 verse was still closely allied to

 primarily ‘rough in sound,’ but
 with a secondary reference also to
 expressions that are too blunt, that
 do not harmonize sufﬁciently with
 the general tone of the writing. —

 itself a fault, the smoothing off of

 judgment. —virtute tarentina this
 carries on the thought of sano,-
 words and phrases which are ⁴ lack-

 taken out altogether, and more
 forcible and expressive words put

 sense cf. Sat. r, 4, Ir, erat quod

 where tollenda and relinquenda
 deﬁne each other.—lndentis: ‘ he
 will look like one who moves with
 ease and pleasure; his style will
 seem to involve no eﬂ‘ort.’ This
 general expression is elaborated in
 the ﬁgure of the trained dancer;
 ‘he will seem to move with ease,
 as a dancer turns this way and

 that and plays now one part, now
 another.’ Cf. Epist. 2, 1, 210,
 where the art of the dramatist is
 compared to the diliicult art of the
 rope dancer. -Satyrnm, Cyclopa:
 this is an allusion to the pantomime
 of the rivalry of a faun (satyr) and
 the Cyclops Polyphemus for the
 love of the nymph Galatea, in
 which a single actor expressed
 alternately in his dancing the feel-
 ing 0f the graceful hun and of the
 clumsy giant. - movetur: the pas-

 — delirum this is one of the syno-

 stultus or ridiculus, because the

 tinctly, the thought and expression

 the underlying thought of the
 Epistles, that Horace has given
 up the writing of poetry and turned
 to the study of philosophy. —

 introduced, as if in direct quota-

 chieﬂy with that false passion
 which Horace always puts ﬁrst
 among the sins of men, the love of
 money and of many possessions.

 x46. ‘ The love of money is like

 the dropsy, with an unsatisﬁed
 thirst for more.’ The same ﬁgure
 is used in Carm. 2, 2, 13-16.

 147-148. ‘In the same way, the
 desire for money increases as it

 the philosophers.— audent sum·

 155-157. This thought also is
 found in Sat. 2, 3, 91ﬂ”. Here,
 however, the desired virtues are
 more deﬁnitely expressed in pru-
 dentem, cupidum timidumque mi·
 nus, since the purpose is not cari-
 cature, but exhortation. Cf. also
 Epist. I, 16, 65, qui cupiet, metuet
 quoquc,· desire and fear are merely
 the two sides of a single passion.

 158 if. ‘Possession consists in
 use; only the man who uses mn
 besaid to possess.'—libra . . . et
 acre: this was one of the tradi-
 tional ways of acquiring property
 by purchase. The scales and
 piece of brass were preserved as
 symbols from the early time when
 brass was money and when it was

 not coined, but was weighed out
 for each purchase. This method
 was called mancipatio.

 159. ⁴ Yet there is another
 method, according to the jurists,
 by which property may be ac-
 quired, namely, by usucapio, that
 is⁷ by possession for a certain
 period.’ Horace intentionally uses
 manctpat in this clause, as if to
 say that usucapio was equivalent
 to mancipatam· this is the basis of
 the argument that follows, in which
 um is really employed in a double
 sense, as a legal term and in the
 more general meaning.

 160. quitepascit: i.c.,⁴of which

 tuus: = proprius, ‘your property,
 because you enjoy it.’——01bi: un-

 who ﬁnally eats the grain.

 ARS POETICA

 Of all the writings of Horace none has been more carefully studied
 and more elaborately discussed than this Epistle. Yet it must be said
 _ that, in consequence of the insuﬂiciency of data, there is still consider-
 ! able uncertainty in regard to the date, the persons addressed, the occa-
 sion and purpose, and even the title.

 The internal evidence in regard to the date of composition or publi-
 mtion is both scanty and indeﬁnite. It is to be found in the references
 to persons, to Vergil and Varius (55), to Cascellius (370), to Tarpa
 (387), and to Varus (438). But no one of these is precise. The con-
 text and the purpose of the allusion is such as to be suitable to a person
 still living or to one who had passed into literary tradition. There is
 a like uncertainty in regard to the allusions to public works in vss. 63 ﬁl;
 they are too vague to afford material for dating.

 The only external evidence of any weight is the statement of Suetonius
 that Augustus asked for and received Epist. 2. l post sermones quosdam
 lectos in which he was not mentioned; these sermones cannot have been
 the First Book of the Epistles, where Augustus is frequently referred to;
 they must have been Epist. 2, 2 — the bare mention of Augustus‘ name
 in vs. 48 does not stand in the way of this— and this Epistle. The
 inference from the statement of Suetonius would therefore be that this
 Epistle was written before Epist. 2, I; that is, in the period between
 the publication of the First Book and the writing of the Carmen Saecu-
 lare, between 19 or 20 n.c. and 17 B.C. Fortunately the character of
 the Epistle is such that a more precise date is not necessary to its in-
 terpretation.

 The persons to whom the letter is supposed to be sent are a father

 x88

 EPISTVLAE [2. 3

 and two sons, the Pisones. From the ,merely formal address in vs. 6
 and vs. 235 and the words 0 Pompilius sanguis in vss. 293 f. no infer-
 ence mn be drawn as to their identity. In vs. 366 the elder son is
 specially addressed in terms which imply, though not very clearly, that
 he was just engaging or might soon engage in poetical composition.
 These are but scanty indications of identity, and the uncertainty is
 increased by the frequency of the name Piso; fourteen persons of that

 ” name are mentioned in the Onomast. Cic., ten in Tacitus, seven in
 Suetonius. But there was a Gn. Calpurnius Piso, some years older
 than Horace, who fought at Philippi and was afterward consul in 23 39c.
 His eldest son, consul in 7 B.C., was born about 44 and would have
 been about twenty-ﬁve when this Epistle was written. There was also
 a younger son. These may be the Pisones addressed, but it is evident
 that any identiﬁcation is at best a mere possibility. As nothing deﬁnite
 is known of the literary interests of these persons, the identiﬁcation,
 even if it were certain, would contribute little to the interpretation-of
 the Epistle.

 The proper title of this poem is also uncertain. It stands ’m most
 of the Ms. E a separate composition, just before or just after the
 Carmen Saeculare, as if it had been published by itself ; and it certainly
 was put into circulation, with some degree of publicity, before Epzst.
 2, ι was written. For such publication its title may have been Epistula
 ad Pisones. But it is referred to by Quintilian, praef. 2, in the words
 . . . Horati consilio, qui in arte poetica suadet . . ., and again, 8, 3,
 60, Horatius in prima parte libri de arte poetica fugit, with a quotation
 of the ﬁrst verse. This is the title used by most of the grammarians
 and by the scholiasts. It is also found in most of the Mss., though it
 may well have been introduced there from the grammatical tradition.
 In most printed editions, because of the subject matter and the date,
 the poem is placed after Epist. 2, 2, as the third Epistle of the Second
 Book, and it is often referred to, for convenience, as Epist. 2, 3. If
 Horace gave it a title, it was probably Epistula ad Pisones, perhaps
 with the addition of de Arte Foetica or Ars Poetica. Tradition has
 ﬁxed upon it the name Ars Poetica.

 The course of thought from sentence to sentence and from one para-
 graph to another is easily followed, but it resists all attempts to reduce
 it to a scheme. All that can be said is that the Epistle-consists of a
 series of remarks upon poetry, followed (from vs. 309 to the end) by
 similar remarks upon the training and ideals of the poet.

 The general course of the thought is as follows : -—

 ‘A poem, like a painting, must be well composed, not tricked out

 189

 2, 3] HORATI

 with inharmonious ornaments; nor should the poet, avoiding one fault,
 fall into its opposite. H ony depends in part upon a wise choice of
 subject, which insures goßfrangement. Choice of words aLso con-
 tributes to harmony of effect, for words suffer change, like all human
 things.

 ⁴ The meters and style of diﬁ'erent kinds of poetry are ﬁxed by tradi-
 tion, from which it is not easy to break away. Tradition also ﬁxes the
 outlines of characters, and in all these matters it is best to follow a good

 el, in order that your characters may spmk as beﬁts their nature
 and their period of life.

 ‘In the drama, too, one should follow the best usage, with ﬁve acts
 and three speakers. As to the chorus, it should take a sympathetic
 part in the action, and the music and the dress of actors should not be
 too prominent. The satyric drama presents peculiar difﬁculties, owing
 to the mingling of the heroic and the comic.

 ‘In the observance of metrical laws our Roman poets are too careless,
 a fault for which, as the history of the Greek drama shows, nothing will
 atone. ' Inspiration is not ,a substitute for training; it is a kind of mad-
 ness and, for myself, I prefer to avoid it and to devote myself to laying
 down laws for other writers.

 _ ‘ The poet must enrich his mind by reading and observation and train

 himself to avoid faults. Not that all faults can be avoided; even Homer
 sometimes nods. Yet, for a poet, mediocrity is failure, and only train-
 ing can teach us how to escape that. We must listen to the real critics,
 not to ﬂatterers. Untrained inspiration is mere madness, and I do not
 want to see you a madman.’

 The fact that the course of thought is rambling is the key to an
 understanding of the Epistle. For this arrangement is not the result
 of carelessness; Horace followed this unsystematic and yet closely
 knit succession of topics from deliberate choice. He was not trying to
 compose a treatise, but to write an epistula, a sermo. Like any epistle,
 it is addressed to certain persons, and, like any sermo, it follows the
 line of easy transition by suggestion from one topic to another. This
 is in itself a form of art, the particular form to which Horace had trained
 himself, and this Epistle is to be interpreted precisely as Εριζςὶ. 2, I and
 2, 2 are to be interpreted. That this intentionally unsystematic poem
 should have been taken for a formal treatise on the art of poetryis
 indeed surprising; the error was due in part to a too literal understand-
 ing of the traditional title, in part to a general tendency among early
 scholars to overvalue the content of classic literature. It should be
 valued rather as a beautifully ﬁnished 3m, to be studied for its skillful

 turns of thought and expression, its perfect phrasing, im easy and mel-
 Mora: other side, the substance of what is said in the Ars Poetica
 comes from two different sources. Porphyrion says in his brief intro-
 duction that Horace has here gathered the teachings of Neoptolemus,

 a rhetorician cf the third century, non quidem omnia, sed eminentalmbna. .

 This may very well be correct; it is at any rate clear that Horace is in

 ’ part repeating and applying some of the traditional doctrines of rhetoric,

 in which, as a lifelong student of the art which he practiced, he was
 certainly interested. To this source is due the large proportion of
 Greek literary history. Of all this it is fair to say that it is interesting
 chieﬂy to students of the history of rhetoric. βυτ Horace does not
 merely repeat traditional doctrine; he also comments upon. it, speaking
 with the authority of an older poet addressing a younger generation of
 literary men. Our incomplete knowledge of the tendencies of the
 period makes it difﬁcult to understand fully the point of some of his
 warnings, but much of it is of universal application, even to modern
 conditions. This is the more valuable part of the Ars Poetica, centering,
 as it does, upon the necessity of adequate training for the professional
 man of letters. It is at the same time a proclamation of Horace’s own
 creed and thus a guide to the interpretation of all his poetry.

 1-37. ‘Harmony is necessary to
 a poem, as to a picture.’

 ι. Humane: the general term
 before the speciﬁc, mulier, as
 often. The chiastic order, adj.-
 noun, noun-adj., is intentional.

 a. valit: should choose, deliber-
 ately—varies: of many colors,
 going beyond nature even in this
 detail.—induoere: lay on, as if
 the body were ﬁrst drawn and
 then the feathers were spread
 over it. ·

 3. undique: i.e., ‘ from all kinds

 of creatures.’ -— membris = dat.
 after »ilduara-uh the result of
 the whole process, especially of
 collatis membris. Strictly taken,
 this clause should be in the form
 of another inﬁnitive; but such a
 use of a clause of result, to express
 some single characteristic of the
 whole, is not uncommon.-—_ turpi-
 ter strum: to be taken together,
 to balance formosa super”; cf.
 turpiter hirtum, Eert. 1, 3,- 22.
 This sense of turpis, ‘ ugly,
 hideous,’ is frequent.

 14. That is, the poem begins as
 an epic in the grand style, dealing
 with the heroic.

 15-16. purpureus . . . pannus:
 this is one of the phrases that have
 come over from Horace into mod-
 ern thought. The allusion is not
 to the purple stripe on the tunic,
 which would not suggest incon-
 gruity to a Roman, but to a patch
 of bright color sewed on where it
 did not belong.

 17-18. These examples may
 very well have been taken from
 poems then in circulation, so that
 the allusions would be at once
 identiﬁed; cf. (la-’fingit Rheni

 enatat: 123., ‘if he is to be repre-

 reference is to the pictures which

 gratitude for escape from peril,
 and which represented the scene
 of escape. Cf. Carm. r, ς, 13 ff.,
 Sat. 2, I, 33 and note.

 amphora: the larger vessel corre-
 sponds to magna professis, vs. 14,
 and the smaller urceus, in a less
 deﬁnite way, to the petty details
 upon which the poet spends his
 efforts. This shifts the thought
 slightly, from the lack of harmony
 to the lack of consistency and te-
 nacity in the purpose of the writer.

 27. The danger of falling into

 the mind of Horace; it is the

 a gladiatorial school, having shops
 about it opening on the street. In
 one of these —at the bottom

 chooses to designate only by giv-

 was successful in details,-even
 in the difficult matter of represent-

 unsuccessful in the total result of

 46. tenuis: to be taken in sense
 especially with amet, as cautus is
 to be taken with spernat,· ‘he
 must be critical (ﬁne, subtle) in
 accepting words, and equally mu-
 tious in rejecting.’ -

 45. promissi carminis nuctore:
 i.e., ‘in the actual work of compo-

 rying out of his intentions.’

 47. dixeris egregie; i.e., ‘your
 diction will be particularly happy,
 successful). This is only a varia-
 tion on the form of vs. 42; it
 might have been facundiae haec

 47—48. callida . . . lunctun: the
 skillful putting together of common
 words, so that the meaning of each
 is slightly shifted, will often pro-
 duce all the effect of novelty.
 Horace was himself particularly
 successful in this, and many such
 combinations may be found in the
 poems, especially in the Odes;
 perhaps the best known is splen-
 dide mendax, though the eﬂ'ect is
 even better seen in less daring
 combinations.

 49. indiciis: tokens, signs, i.e.,
 ‘words,’ used instead of verbis to
 carry out the ﬁgure of monstrare
 abdita-abdita rerun: a rather
 frequent form of expression; Sat.
 2, 2, 25, vanis rerum,· 2, 8, 83,
 fetis rerum. The meaning is
 ‘to express ideas hitherto un-
 expressed, by means of words
 which will necessarily be new.’

 so. ﬁngen: the making of new
 words is most happily illustrated
 by cinctutis, which does not occur
 before this in the extant literature
 and was probably coined by
 Horace. It means ‘clad in the
 cinctus,’ a kind of loin cloth or
 kilt which was used before the
 tunic as an undergarment—Ce-

 Roman vombulary. He does,
 however, make large use of words
 suggested by Greek compounds or
 derivatives (centimanus, inaudax,
 perhaps potenter, vs. 40), in which
 a new meaning is given to a
 Latin stem. This slight shift of
 meaning is expressed in parce de·
 torta. The novelty would in such
 words be essentially the same as
 that given to Roman words by the
 callida iunctura.

 54. dabit, ademptum: the illogi-
 cal structure (for datum, adimet)
 is intentional and points to some
 deﬁnite criticism; ‘ he has already
 refused the right to Vergil. Is
 he now proposing to grant it to
 Plautus ?’ Both during his life-
 time and after his death Vergil
 was criticized on the ground that
 his style was not pure Latin, as is
 evident, for instance, from the
 parody of Eclog. 3, x, cuium pecus,
 anne Latinum .7 It is against
 some critic of this school that this
 question is directed. -— Romulus:
 with emphasis ; ‘ and he a Roman !’

 55. plum: this is the same as

 siampta pudenter, vs. 5!, and the
 opposite of ditaverit.
 56. invideor: the usual passive

 ,is invidetur mihi, preserving in

 thepassive the dative construction
 of the active voice. This dative,

 however, is essentially the same r

 thing as an accus., and the use of
 invideor is merely a sporadic in-
 stance of the process of adjusting
 language, by analogy, to prevailing
 tendencies. It has nothing what-
 ever to do with φθονσῦμαι. -

 ritu: ‘like the generations of men.‘
 Here also a part of the thought —
 ‘ and ﬁnally perish ’ — is left to be
 supplied from the context.

 63—68. ‘All things perish, even
 the greatest works of men.’ This
 general truth is illustrated by allu-
 sions to three great pieces of
 engineering work, planned or un-
 dertaken by Julius Caesar or
 Augustus. The course of thought
 demands that they should be works
 which were either carried to com-
 pletion or at least so far advanced

 that Horace could think of them
 as practically completed. The
 ﬁrst is either the cutting into the
 Lucrine Lake to make a harbor
 (a work of no great magnitude,
 carried out by Agrippa) or the
 making of a similar harbor at
 Ostia (planned by Julius Caesar
 and perhaps carried on by Au-
 gustus). The second was the
 draining of the Pomptine marshes,
 also planned by Julius Caesar,
 but never completed. The third
 was the straightening of the Tiber
 to prevent ﬂoods and protect the
 farm lands; this was another large
 project ascribed to Caesar, and
 some progress was made upon lt
 under Augustus. So far as we
 can judge, with our scanty knowl-
 edge, Horace is alluding to great
 works which seemed to be so far
 advanced that he could regard
 them as completed. Whether the
 ﬁrst was the Lucrine Lake or the
 port at Ostia does not matter to
 the sense—ugh opus: a royal

 work—palm: this is a very un- _

 usual prosody. — iniquum frugi-
 bus= this would imply that the
 work was done on the river either
 above or below the city.

 equites peditesqne: Horace fre-
 quently uses eques, equites, to de-

 - note the more cultivated part of

 the audience or of the reading
 public. Here, desiring to refer to
 the whole audience, he uses the
 customary word, and then humor-
 ously adds pedites, playing upon
 the literal meaning of equites.

 314. divusne an heros : i.e., be-
 tween a god and a man, even a
 hero such as would appear on the
 stage with a divinity.

 315-118. Classical drama was
 more limited and conventional in
 its range of characters than modern
 fiction, and the persons represented
 are easily classiﬁed, as here. Such

 writings. Horace is merely select-
 ing a few well-known types, in
 contrasting pairs, the old man and
 the young man, the mistress of the
 household and the old nurse, the
 trader or sailor and the farmer. —
 ln vs. 138 the contrast is carried
 out rather elaborately; the two
 barbarians are contrasted with the
 two Greeks, and then with each
 other. This corresponds to reality
 in the contrast of the Colchian
 (the wilder and more savage type)
 with the Assyrian (the effeminate
 Oriental), but there is not, in re-
 ality or in tradition, any such dis-
 tinct contrast between the Theban
 and the Argive. Horace is prob-
 ably thinking of the legends which
 brought the two cities into conﬂict,
 like the Seven against Thebes of
 Aeschylus.

 119. This line, again, is both
 summary and transition, carrying
 the thought on from harmony be-
 tween the speaker and his words
 to harmony in the character it-
 self.

 therefore means ‘to write about
 things which no other writer has
 handled, things which are not a
 part of literature, but which belong
 ω’ common experience, in such a
 way as to make them your own
 (proprie).⁷ The thought of the
 whole is, ‘it is hard to put the
 stamp of individuality upon ordi-
 nary material, and you will ﬁnd it
 easier to dramatize some story
 from the Trojan cycle than to
 strike out into unknown ﬁelds.’—
 tu: the poet, not one of the
 Pisones.——Iliacmn carmen: not
 necessarily the whole Iliad.—
 ‘ Yet a certain measure of original-
 ity in the handling of old material
 may be attained, if you use the
 right meth'od.’—publica: such as
 the Homeric story. —- privati iuris :
 i.e., ‘will become your own, ’will
 bear your stamp.’ This ﬁgure, of
 acquiring private rights in what
 had been public property, was in
 Horace’s mind from the beginning
 of the sentence and undoubtedly
 led to the choice of the rather con-
 fusing phrase proprie communia.
 Cf. also Epist. I, 3, ις E, where
 the same ﬁgure is used in a dif-
 ferent way.-patulum . . . orbem=

 then of the commonplace path
 which most writers of little origi-
 nality follow. — interpres, imitator :
 this appears to have been espe-
 cially frequent in Roman tragedy,
 so far as can be judged from the
 fragments, though even there it
 is not quite what we understand
 by a ‘word-for-word’ translation;
 Horace is contrasting it with his
 own freer following of Alcaeus
 and Sappho-denies in artum:
 the phrase seems to be, a reminis-
 cence of the fable of the goat that
 jumped into a well, but the com-
 parison is not to be mrried over
 into the next line.—pudor: i.e.,
 an unwillingness to acknowledge
 your error. -operis lex= no more
 than ‘the nature of the work’; a
 close imitation will bind the writer
 so closely to the plot of his model
 that he cannot free himself at all
 without destroying the unity of
 the work.

 136. The form of sentence, nec
 with the future, goes on, though
 the subject changes from origi-
 nality to the treatment of the
 beginning of a poem. This con-
 tinuation of grammatical structure
 is intended to make the transition
 easy and unperceived, as in all

 his writings Horace avoids formal
 arrangements of thoughtr-cycli-
 cua: a technical name given by
 Alexandrine critics to the poets
 who handled parts of the Trojan
 story not included in the Iliad or
 Odyssey; their poems, with the
 Homeric poems, form a complete
 circle (cyclus).

 337-138. The absurdity, as Hor-
 ace sees it, is in the largeness
 of the promise, and perhaps in
 nobile. But there is much that
 is conventional and unreal in this
 paragraph, vss. 137-142. Cf. the
 noble opening sentence of Para-
 dise Lost. -promiuore apparently
 coined to -ridicule the cyclic poet.

 gestion, as if the poet opened
 his mouth wide to utter such a

 139. Notice the effect of the
 monosyllabic _close.

 141-142, Cf) Epz'st. I, 2,- 19-21,
 where the ﬁrst lines of the Odyssey
 are freely rendered. Horace has
 simpliﬁed Homer by omitting the
 second line, ἒπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτο-
 λίεθρον ἔπερσε.

 the writer did who, having for his
 subject the return of Diomed from
 Troy, went back by way of intro-
 duction and told the other story
 of the tragic death of his uncle,
 Meleager.

 fact it was.

 The Latin construction here is
 clumsy and should not be used in

 153. mentitur: i.e., uses Jiclions.

 in the main historical.

 his characters consistent and life-

 tice the characteristics of different
 periods in life.’

 153. tu: the poet, as in 128.
 The abrupt line introduces a new

 spoken sometimes by the com-
 pany (grex), sometimes by the last
 actor, and sometimes (Plaut. Trin.,
 M.G., and all the plays of Ter-
 ence) there is no indication of the
 speaker. There is no allusion
 elsewhere to a cantor, nor mn
 anything be inferred from this
 passage in regard to the usage in
 the time of Terence.

 156. notandi: ‘observed with
 care.’

 The description of the different

 bilities and needs of the drama.
 The first stage, vss. I 58—160, would
 not be represented in tragedy or
 comedy, characteristics are men-
 tioned which, though they can be
 noticed by a writer of novels, could
 scarcely be indicated within the
 conventional limits of Greek or
 Latin drama (I64, tardus pro-
 visor,- 165; 167, amicitias,- 171),
 and, in general, much stress is laid
 upon the quickness of change
 (1573 iam, I58; I60; 166; ι75)
 from one period to another.
 Horace has carried his descrip-
 tion beyond his first intention.
 159—160. ignat: i.e., leaves
 tracks (stgna) as he walks.—ges-
 tit: of the child's eagerness for
 play. —temere: without cause.
 163-165. tandeim i.e., the long-
 desired time has come and he is
 his own masten-custodes the
 paedagogus, as Horace‘s father was
 to him, Sat. 1, 6, 81. -eqnis cani-

 busque: this has a Greek sound;
 cf. Ter. Andr. 56 f., aut equos alen
 aut canes ad venandum, of a young
 man’s ﬁrst interests, when he is out
 of his father’s control. —cereus:
 the ﬁgure which this word suggests
 does not extend to ﬂectx'; ‘ impres-
 sible as wax and easily turned
 toward folly.’ — monitoribus as-
 per: cf. the scene in Plaut. Bacch.
 109 ﬂ‘. —provisor: ‘slow to pro-
 vide . . . ’; the corresponding
 phrase in Aristotle (KM. 2, 12)
 is ἥκιστα.

 166-168. ltudiis: his interests.
 —opes: in the general sense, ‘ in-
 ﬂuence and power,’ which connects
 well with amicitias, ‘ alliances ‘ for
 inﬂuence, such as Cicero discuss
 and condemns; cf. also Sal. 2, 6,
 75. —honori: qﬂica.

 is found in various places, e.g., in
 Cic. de Sweat, and especially in
 scenes in Terence. -vel quod : not

 per and other metals—its note
 was more like that of a brass horn
 (tuba), less clear and simple.

 204. adspirare, adeue: as an ac-
 companiment to the choral song,
 without independent force.

 205. nondum: especially with
 erat utilis to be supplied. - nimis z
 with spissa. ‘The ﬂute was not
 yet used, as it is now, to ﬁll with
 loud blast a crowded theater,’ i.e.,
 was not independent of the song.

 206. quo: the antecedent is
 sedilia, for the whole theater.-

 sane: ‘of course,’ ‘you know.’—
 utpote parvum parenthetic and
 explanatory of numerabilis.

 207. The adjectives desa'ibe
 the ideal simplicity and piety of
 the early time, which Horace here
 regards as necessary to the purity
 of art.

 208—210. In the preceding dis-
 cussion of the drama there is
 nothing to indicate that Horace
 was thinking exclusively of the
 Greek tragedy; on the contrary,
 the advice is of course addressed
 to writers of Roman tragedy. Yet
 the tone is almost wholly Greek.
 As the discussion goes on, how-
 ever, to the period of luxury, the
 underlying thought is Roman.
 This appears in agros extendere
 victor, which is not strictly appli-
 cable to Greek history after the
 Persian Wars, but is accurately de-
 scriptive of Roman history after
 the Punic Wars. The plural urbes
 would suggest Greek cities; latior
 murus is suitable to either; but

 honesto: where there was no such
 distinction as that which in Hor-
 ace’s time separated the equites-
 the cultivated part of the audience
 -from the lower classes.

 214-215. sic: as a result of this
 confusion and this increase of
 luxury.—motum: z’.e., he moved
 about the stage (vagus), no longer
 subordinating himself to the 'cho—
 rus.-—luxuriem: 1’.e., he trailed
 his purple robe (traxit vestem)

 236. voces: notes. The tradi-

 {inn was that 111:.- lym* was al ﬁrst

 four-stringed, and that the number -

 of strings was gradually increased
 to eleven.

 237. tnlit: brought in, ‘brought
 with it.’ —‘eloqnium: style. - fa-
 cundia praeceps: ‘ the eager desire
 to speak, unrestrained (praeceps)
 by considerations of taste.‘ The
 same licentia maior which had
 affected music inﬂuenced also the
 style of the choral odes(

 the thought itself was affected by
 the same tendencies and came to

 futuri: the chorus undertook to
 prophesy, and became as obscure
 and bombastic as oracles. The
 precise point of these criticisms

 is not clear, nor even whether ,

 Horace has in mind the later
 Greek tragedy or the Roman.
 This whole passage, vss. 202—219,
 is to be regarded as a bit of the
 traditional rhetorical doctrine and
 not as history or direct criticism.
 The point of view is wholly incor-
 rect.

 This section also is in part tradi-
 tional, but it is in part a real criti-
 cism of forms of drama which were
 on the stage in Horaoe’s time, like
 mimes and fabulae Atellanae, and
 which bore enough resemblance
 to the Satyr plays to justify Hor-
 ace in treating them all as one
 kind of drama.

 220-221. certavitz this is Greek,
 referring to the dramatic contests
 at Athens. - hircum: the com—

 » «apply accepted derivation of

 γᾷδῖἂ was from τράγος, a goat
 ﬁ'ere as the prize of victory.—
 mox, i.e., the Satyr play is sup-
 posed to be derived from tragedy.
 This is the reverse of the fact;
 formal tragedy was a development
 out of the popular Satyr play and
 the name comes from the use of
 τράγος of the chorus of the Satyr
 drama. — nudavit: the Satyrs were
 naked except for a goatskin about
 the loins. —aper: 11s., he was
 still a tragic poet, with something
 of the severity of tragedy. The
 Satyr play, as a fourth play after
 the dramatic trilogy, was written

 by the same poet who had written
 the tragedies.

 222. incolumi gravitate: ‘with-
 out loss of dignity ’ by presenting
 such plays.

 223. morandus: i.e., ‘it was
 necessary to provide some amuse-
 ment and novelty to detain the
 spectators.’

 224. functus pectin: ‘ having
 already performed the solemn rites
 of sacriﬁce, they were released
 from restraint (exlex).’

 225. verum: ‘but, though the
 spectators were exlex and the ob-
 ject of the play was laughter and
 jesting, there were still restraints
 imposed upon the characters and
 the style of the plays.’— rigorem
 in effect an adj., merry, to balance
 dicaces, jesting, commendaret
 i.e., ‘present them to the favor
 of the audience.’

 226. vertere seria ludo: the
 Satyr play, coming immediately
 after the tragedies, changed the
 spirit from seriousness to lightness.
 The abl. (ludo) is rare with verto,
 but is found occasionally after the
 analogy of the abl. with muto.

 237-239. Davus : a standing

 Pythias: this name for the arguta

 these words are not quite intelli-

 258. socialiter: ‘like an ally,’

 personiﬁcation of the iambus goes
 through the whole passage, iussit,
 recepit, commodus et patiens, ce-
 deret.

 · 259—262. ‘In Roman poets the
 frequency of spondees makes

 Greek drama.

 270. proaviz in a general sense,
 maiores. ——— Plantinos: for Horace’s
 judgment on Plautus see Epist. 2,
 I, I70 if. and note. -—numeros:
 this may be a reference to the
 verses which were supposed to be
 Plautus⁷s own epitaph, in which
 the phrase numeri innumeri is

 ‚ used. Plautus was, in fact, an ex·

 tremely good versiﬁer, but of a
 sort that Horace did not appre-
 ciate.

 271-272. patienter: i.e., they
 should not have endured them,
 much less admired them.

 273. inurbanum lepido: with ref-
 erence to the sales. The word
 lepidus, which Horace uses rarely,
 is one of the commonest adjectives
 in Plautus and is chosen here for

 that reason. The standard 0W μ..

 cml-

 banilas is better suited to the Au-
 gustan age than to the time of the
 Second Punic War.

 274. sonmn: the numeri. Hor-
 aoe’s judgment on this point also,
 as on the wit of Plautus, is too
 narrow, like the judgment of a
 Queen Anne writer on a poet
 of the Elizabethan period. —
 digitis: this seems to be tradi-
 tional; Horace did not count
 the feet of his Alcaim on his
 ﬁngers. But it is true that the
 natural feeling for the free early
 versiﬁcation had, in part, died
 out under the impulse toward ﬁn-
 ished accuracy.

 275. The order of thought here
 is more important than the gram-
 matical structure; ‘ tragedy was an
 unknown kind of poetry before its

 Thespis: the ‘inventor’ of trag-
 edy, as Homer was of the epic
 and Archilochus of iambis. But,
 properly understood, no form of
 art was ever invented.

 277. canerent, agerentz Horace
 uses the plural a little mrelessly,
 in speaking of a play in which
 there was only one actor. -per-
 uncti faecibusz this quite uncer-
 tain tradition, if it has any founda-
 tion in fact, has to do with comedy,
 ·- not with tragedy.

 “ 278-280. The innovations here
 attributed to Aeschylus are the
 mmk, the special dress, the ele-
 vated wooden stage, and the thick-
 soled tr'agic boot. There are traces
 of these traditions in various au-
 thors, but the source from which
 Horace derived them is unknown.
 -honostao : digniﬁed ; with pallae
 only, not with personae. -modi-
 cis: a qualiﬁcation of the tradi-
 tion; the ﬁrst stage would natu-
 rally be thought of as small. -
 mgnum loqui: inserted into the

 account of th stage machinery to
 go with niti.

 281. vetus: ἀρχαὰις the techni-
 cal name for the comedy of which
 Aristophanes is the only extant
 representative. Cf. Sat. 1,4, 1—2;
 3, ιο, 16 f.

 282-283. libertam so Sat. r, 4,
 5, multa cum libertate notabant.
 ‘ But this freedom degenerated
 (enidtlt) into a fault.’ ——— vim: the
 technical word for ‘ assault,’ ‘ ille-
 gal violence.’ -lege : the accounts
 are somewhat confused and it is
 more probable that the law against
 extreme personalities on the stage
 had nothing to do with the decline
 of the chorus.

 284. turpiter= with obticuit ,· the
 silence was discreditable because
 it was, as Horace understood it,
 the result of the withdrawal of the
 right to do harm. —This reference
 to the loss of the chorus has, in
 fact, nothing to do with the main
 thought, and comedy is mentioned
 only to lead up to the general
 statement nil intentatum.

 Calpus. This form of address is
 hardly more than a variation on
 Pisones.

 294. praesectum . . . ad unguent

 expression of indiﬁ'erence; cf. Cic.

 sources. The important ‘ Socratic ’

 potemnt: ‘ they will, for example,
 contain such suggestion as you
 need.’ _

 311. rem . . . sequentur: this rule
 appears in various forms, most
 concisely in Cato’s rem tene, verba
 sequentur, and humorously in the
 saying of Asinius Pollio, male
 hercle eveniat verbale, nisi rem sc-
 quantur.

 314. conscripti: councilor,· the
 word is familiar in the formula
 patres conscripti, but is here used
 in a more general sense, as in
 inscriptions (neve ibi senator neve
 decurio neve conscrtptus esto,
 C.1.L., I, 206, 96). This is the
 only passage except in inscriptions
 where the word is used alone with-
 out pater. - iudicis: such an
 ofﬁcial combined some of the
 functions now divided between
 the judge and the jury; cf. Sat.
 Ῐ, 47 23‘

 316. personne: dramatic poetry
 is here, as in so much of this
 Epistle, uppermost in Horace’s
 mind. —— conveniantne i.e., to

 make the speech of each character

 317-318. ⁴ The poet who desires
 that his work should be a reﬂec-
 tion of life (imitatorem) and who
 has learned the principles of life
 and art from study (doctum = qui
 didzkit) will then tum to life itself,
 ,- to the observation of character
 . (morum), and from this, as from a

 q x model, will learn to give vividuess
 Ι “ to the speeches (vivas voces) of

 [the persons of his drama.‘
 x 319-322. ‘For a vivid and life-

 '_ like portrayal of character is often
 j more effective than a merely artis·
 - tic ﬁnish.’ — speciosa loois: i.e.,

 ‘which contains vivid and at-
 ractive passages (vivus voces),

 > speeches that attract the atten-

 ‘tion of the hearer’; cf. Epist.

 ~ 2, x, 223.- morataque recto:

 ‘in which the speeches conform
 properly to the characters that
 utter them,’ as is suggested in

 .' exemplar morum. - nulliusve-

 neris: ‘ without the attractiveness
 of lofty words (sine pondere) or
 artistic polish.’ The thought is
 again expressed by contrast in
 inopes rerum nugaeque canorae.

 323-332. ‘lt is to the Greeks
 that philosophy and art have given
 the power to realize these ideals.’

 324. avaris: the word is selected
 in anticipation of the thought that
 follows; ‘ for the Greeks are eager
 only for glory, while we Romans
 are avari in a worse sense.’

 325. longis rationibns= *long
 calculations’ like the ‘examples’
 in arithmetic.

 326. centrum the as was di-
 vided into twelfths, unciae, and
 the Roman reckonings were based

 348—350. The comparison, as so
 often in Horace, is merely implied ;
 ‘such failings of a poet are like the
 mistakes of the musician or the
 archer.’ —- gravem: low. — per-
 saape: there is an apologetic tone
 in this word; very often, so weak
 is human skill. -feriet ς the future
 tense, instead of the present reddit,
 remittit, represents the archer as
 already excusing his possible miss,
 before he shoots.

 352. offendar maculis: this is
 the doctrine of Sat. 1, 3, 68 ﬁ'. and
 almost the same form of expression
 as that in Sat. ι, 6, 65—67. The
 use of maculis· anticipates the com-
 parison of vs. 354.—fudit: as if
 by the spilling of ink.

 often; ‘and, on the other hand.’
 — indignor: not ‘ I am angry,’ but
 in its proper sense, ‘I count it
 unworthy of him.’—-quandoque:
 = quandocumque ,· the different
 forms of the indefinite relative were
 never as clearly differentiated in
 usage as they are in the grammars.
 —bonus: a standing epithet.—
 dormitat: cf. dormire, Sat. 2, 1, 7,
 in a figurative sense not unlike
 this.—Vs. 360 is a humorous ex·
 cuse playing upon the literal sense
 of dormitat. - The thought here is
 only apparently contradictory to
 vs. 347 and vss. 351 f.; non ego

 haec αωανὶζξῖἕιῗῖιῖἧη volet haec sub luce videri,

 paucis ofendar maculis means ‘I
 will not condemn a whole poem
 for a few faults’; z'ndigﬂor . . .
 Homerus does not mean ‘I am
 angry with Home: for his few
 faults,’ but rather ‘I so admire
 Homer that, when he makes an
 occasional slip, my only feeling-is
 that it is unworthy of so great a
 poet.’ The word indignor is not
 the same as ofendar; it is selected
 for the contrast with cum ritu
 miror and means scarcely more
 than ‘I wonder at it,’ ‘I am sur-
 prised.’

 361-365. ut pictura, possint the
 comparison is not original; cf.
 Auct. ad Herenn. 4, 28, 39, poema
 loquens pictura, pictura tacitum
 poema debet esse. It should be
 noticed that the comparison, which
 is suggested by the thought of vss.

 attitude of the critic toward works
 of art, either pictures or poems, not
 their essential characteristics. —— In

 always a tendency to let the mind
 rest upon one side, sometimes to
 the exclusion of the other side.
 The contrast in propius, longius
 is primarily pictorial, not poetic,
 though it doubtless means, secon-
 darily, to contrast poetry highly
 ﬁnished in details with poetry on
 a larger scale, like an epic. But
 haec amat obscurum, which is a
 very just remark about some paint-
 ings, is almost meaningless when
 used of a poem. The last line, vs.
 365, is written with poetry prima-
 rily in mind (repetila), though it
 applies equally well to a picture.

 366. major iuvenum= this is
 almost the only personal touch in
 the epistle, and it is not certain
 that this address to the elder
 brother means anything more than
 that he is now old enough to be
 making his choice of a career.

 367. ad rectum: in matters of
 taste; d'. recte, vs. 309.—perte
 sepia: a polite phrase to take oﬁ'
 the edge of the rather earnest

 dictum: in vss. 372 f.

 368. tolle manor: i.c., ⁴ wry
 away with you and store in your
 memory,’ as if the epistle were
 really a sermo. —medium: not as
 Horace often uses the ward, but
 ‘ mediocre,’ ‘ moderately good.’

 369. consultus, actor: the two
 branches of the legal profession,
 the jurist and the pleader.

 37o. mediocris: the emphatic
 word; ‘of only moderate ability.’
 —abest: i.e., ‘ fails to attain to.‘

 371. lessen“: cf. Sat, 1, to,
 29, note. He was a man of much
 distinction in several ﬁelds. —
 Cascellium distinguished in the
 Ciceronian period as a jurist and
 an orator. He was probably not
 living at this time.

 372—373. in pretio: of value;
 a term of moderate praise.— medi-
 ocribus: dative in the predicate;
 d’. Sat. x, r, 19, licet esse beatis. -

 This is the dictum of vs. 367.
 —— columnae z an intentionally lofty
 word for the pilae (Sat. 1, 4, 71),
 posts in front of the shop where
 announcements of books or copies
 of the books themselves were hung
 to attract buyers. There is also
 an intentional anticlimax in Immi-
 nes, di, columnae.

 374-376. ‘This is true of any
 ' luxury; only the best is really
 good.’ -— symphonia discors: to
 the educated Roman leader, ac-
 quainted with Greek, the contra-
 diction in these words would be
 as obvious as in the phrase con-
 cordia discors, Epist. I, 12, 19.
 Music was often played during a

 ——Sardo: of inferior quality.—

 ing the actor and the orator.

 37g. ludere: the general sense
 which this word has when stand· ·

 oampestribus . . . armisz those
 which are mentioned in the next
 verse.

 380. pilae: Sat. r, 5, 49. ——

 vs. II) these two forms of Greek
 athletics are contrasted with hunt-
 ing and riding.

 381. impune: i.e., there would
 be no ground on which the player
 who was laughed at could resent
 the ridicule; justly, properly.

 382. qui nescitz this is the
 opinion expressed in Epist. 2, I,
 114-117, under a slightly different
 ﬁgure.

 In this phrase ni has no condi-

 eral remarks of vs. 374 ﬁ'.‚ to the

 tamen), like quamvis . . . perte

 same courteous intention. -invita
 . . . Minerva; this phrase was
 proverbial and is explained by
 Cicero (de 0f. 1, 31, no), invita
 Minerva, ut aiunt, id est, adver-
 sante et repugnante natura. Mi-
 nerva is here the goddess of the
 intellectual powers.

 386. id, ea: such. The con-
 struction is paratactic for ‘such
 is your judgment that you will
 say nothing. . . .’

 387. Haoci: Sp. Maecius Tarpa,
 named in Sat. x, IO, 38 as a critic
 of authority. He is named here
 merely as a representative of the

 severe criticism to which the writ-
 ings cf a young man should be
 submitted.

 388. et patris et nostras: as
 critics also, though perhaps more
 friendly critics.—-nonum . . . in an-
 num: this famous precept is not
 to be understood literally or deﬁ-
 nitely. The meaning is that a
 young writer should hold back
 his work for mature consideration
 and revision. 'The number (no-
 num) was perhaps chosen because
 the poet Helvius Cinna spent nine

 *years in the writing and correcting

 of his epic Smyrna (Catull. 95,
 1-2). But this mse was by no
 means unique; Vergil spent seven
 years upon the Georgics and left
 the Aeneid unﬁnished after ten
 years of work upon it.

 390. vox missae the expression
 is ﬁgurative; literally, it refers to
 the spoken Word, as in Epiri. 1,
 18, 71, semel emissum volat inevo-
 cabile verbum.

 largely to the movement of civili-
 zation.’ This thought is repeated
 in substance in Epist. 2, 1, 118-
 138. But the tone there is less
 historical and more abstract, and
 there is consequently little repe-
 tition of phrases or illustrations.

 39:. silvestria i.c.,men in their
 primitive state, still living in the
 woods—sneer: the poet is vates,

 . inspired singer, interpreter of the
 divine will.

 392. victu foedo: i.c., the acorns
 and nuts which they livqi upon as
 the animals did. The adj. foedo
 is used in a general way of the
 kind of life, rather than of any-
 thing unpleasant in the food itself.

 393. dictus ob hoc: ‘this is the
 origin of the legend of his taming
 tigers.’

 394. dictus : the repetition of the
 word at the beginning of the line is
 meant to suggest that the story of
 Amphion is also a legend, the real
 purpose of which is to express in
 vivid form the power of the singer.

 395. prece: his song moved

 rocks as it moved the gods, when
 it was addressed to them; cf.
 Epist. 2, r, r 35, docta prece
 blandus, of the chorus.

 396. base: referring back to the
 work of Orpheus and Amphion,
 and then analyzed and explained
 in the following inﬁnitive phrases.

 397—399. Cf. the similar account
 of the evolution of society in Sat.
 1, 3, 99-110, where, however, it
 is used to support the Epicurean
 doctrine that all moral ideas are
 derived from utilitas. - ooncubitu
 . . .vngo: ventrem incertam rapi-
 entis more ferarum, Sat. 1, 3, 109.
 -muitiez ‘to husband and wife.’
 The regulation of marriage was
 one of the most important matters
 of Roman law-lignee perhaps a
 reference to the tradition that the
 laws of Solon were made public
 on wooden tablets. But there is
 a similar tradition in regard to the
 Twelve Tables.

 4οο. sic: because poets were
 leaders in 'all these civilizing
 movements.

 405—406. Indus . . . ﬁnis: dra-

 matic poetry. The thought is
 more fully expressed in Epist. 2, -
 1, 139-142. -ne forte: a ‘paren-
 thetic’ clause of purpose, summa-
 rizing the argument of vss. 391-

 408—415. ‘Both nature and art
 must contribute to make a good
 poet — though I know that this is
 not the accepted doctrine.’

 408. natural . . . an arte= this

 swered as here by saying that

 trades and professions, in vs.

 here by a reference to the practice

 [This is Bentley’s conjecture. The
 reading of the Mss., atris, cannot
 be justiﬁed by atra cura]

 424. inter . . . noscere: cf. Sat.
 2, 3, 117 f., unde . . . octoginta,-
 Eptlrt. 2, 2,93. It is to be remem-
 bered that to the Roman feeling the
 difference between the juxtaposi-
 tion of two words and their compo-
 sition into a single word was much
 less distinct than it is in English.
 The habit of mding from print
 prevents us from perceiving actual
 composition in such a phrase, for
 example, as not at all.

 425. bestus: ‘in his self-satis-
 faction.’

 426. donarls: = demerir; ‘if
 you already have some person who
 is under obligation to you.’

 427. tibi factos: ‘the verses that
 you, his host and benefactor, have
 made.’

 429. super his: ‘at this or that
 passage,’ which is intended to ex-
 cite terror. '

 430. galiota as an expression of
 joy, when that is the proper emo-
 tion. —tundet. . . terram = when he
 hears of the wickedness of the vil-
 lain of the drama. — All this is, of
 course, a humorous exaggeration
 of natural expressions of emo-
 tion.

 431. conducti: for hirc. There
 are various allusions to the custom
 of hiring women (praefica) to
 accompany a funeral procession
 with cries of grief. The masculine
 is used in order that the phrase
 may be more directly applicable to
 the ﬂattering friend.

 432. ex snimo: with dolentibus,
 contrasting with conducti.

 433. derisor: i.c., ⁴ the man who
 is pretending to admire, but is in
 his heart laughing at the poet for “
 being so easily fooled.’— movetur :
 ‘makes a greater show of emotion,’
 as already described.

 437. fallent= i.e., ‘you need not

 allusion is to the fox who ﬂattered
 the raven in order to get the bit of
 cheese (Phaedr. x, 13)= keeping
 his real purpose (animi) out of

 439. negates: a condition with-
 out si expressed, but dependent
 upon si of vs. 438, which is again
 expressed in vs. 442'.

 441. ‘If, on a second or third
 attempt, the verses prove incapable
 of improvement, then they must
 be stricken out and the thought
 must be expressed in some eu-
 tirely new form, as a metal worker
 puts a piece of work that cannot
 be properly ﬁnished back upon the
 anvil and begins all over again.’
 The ﬁnishing of the metal work
 was sometimes done on the lathe,
 and male tornatos means ‘which
 come out badly in the ﬁnishing
 process.’ Such work would be
 taken back to the anvil (incudi),
 to be forged over again.

 442. vertere: la change, to
 amend. In this general sense
 vertere needs some additional de-
 ﬁning phrase, usually in with the
 accus.; here the deﬁnition is al-
 ready given by defendere debitum.

 443. inanem= predicate; to no
 efect.

 444. sine rivalix with solus ,· the
 phrase is used by Cic. (ad Q. Fr.
 3, 8, 4.) as if it were proverbial.

 445—449. The attitude of the
 frank and competent critic, which
 has been outlined in the reminis-
 cence of Quintilius Varus, is here
 deﬁned in more general terms,
 with the vir bonus et prudens sub-
 stituted for Quintilius and with
 future tenses instead of imperfects.
 The process of revision is illus-
 trated in details which are un-
 doubtedly drawn from Horace‘s
 own experience and practice and
 which therefore reveal to us some-
 thing of his method of work.
 The faults selected for illustration
 are those which Horace has es-
 pecially endeavored to avoid;
 versus inertes (ﬂat, lacking in
 vigor of expression), duros (harsh
 in sound and rhythm), incomptis

 ‘(ill-arranged in order of thought),

 ambitiosa (aiming too directly at
 effect), parum claris (words which
 do not suﬂiciently express the
 thought), ambigue datum (phrase
 which are capable of more than
 one interpretation). Some of
 these have parallels in Epist. 2, 2,
 122 f. There is a careful varia-
 tion in the verbs also; reprehen-
 det, culpabit, arguet are general,
 adlinet atrum signum, recidd,
 lucem dare coget are more spe-
 ciﬁc.

 45o. Aristarchus: the famous
 Homeric critic, who lived in Alex-
 andria in the second century n.c.
 His name had become typical of
 the severe critic.

 451—452. hae nuguz ‘these
 things which you call triﬂes.’—
 derisum semel: the poet who Ins
 once been ridiculed in public {or
 faults which may be in themselves
 triﬂing has suffered a loss of repu-
 tation from which he can scarcely
 recover.

 453—476. ‘Allow me, in conclu-
 sion, to hold up to you the picture
 of the kind of poet you should try
 not to be—the crazy fool, who
 thinks himself inspired.’

 453. morbus reginae this phrase
 embalms two popular errors, that
 jaundice was a contagious disease
 and that it was somehow espe-
 cially connected with kings or with
 the rich; to account for the latter
 various fanciful explanations were
 given.

 454. fanaticus error: the fran-
 tic dancing of the priests of Bel-
 lona (Sat. 2, 3, 223, gaudens
 cruentis), who went about the
 streets cutting themselves in frenzy
 and begging from the passers-by.
 The word fanaticus (fromfanum)
 was used especially of the priests
 and worship of Bellona and Cy-
 bele. - Dianae as moon god-
 dess, wh0se beams were supposed
 to cause lunacy (luna).

 455. vesanum: = insanum.

 456. qui sapiunt: = .mpz'mtes;
 subject of timent fugiuntque and
 contrasted with incauti. - agi·
 tant: at the beginning of the

 clause with adversative effect. The
 picture of the poet in the rble of
 the madman, tormented by street
 boys (cf. Sat. ι, 3, 133 ff), while
 the more reckless of the people
 follow behind to look on, and the
 cautious and respectable citizens
 cross to the other side of the
 street, is highly eﬁ'ective in its
 ridicule.

 457. sublimine ‘with his head
 in the air.’

 458. merulis intentus : this reads
 like an allusion to some well-
 known story, but no such story
 has come down to us.

 459—460. longum: ‘so as to be
 heard afar.’ —— non sit: the gram-
 matical construction is si . . . de-
 cidit, licet . . . clamet, non sit ,·
 the indicative of the condition
 would naturally be followed by an
 indicative non est in the conclu-
 sion, but the concessive clause licet
 . . . clamet comes in and forms a
 new protasis, under the influence
 of which the apodosis takes a sub-
 junctive; if ‘he falls into a well,
 even though he should cry out, no
 one would help him.’

 pedocles of Agrigentum, philoso-
 pher, poet, and statesman of the
 ﬁfth century B.c. About his life
 and death various legends grew
 up, the one of widest currency
 being this, that he threw himself
 into the crater of Aetna. The best
 thing to be said of this story is that
 it furnished the theme for Matthew
 Amold’s ‘ Empedocles on Etna.’

 464. deus immortalisz this was
 one of the motives ascribed to him
 for the deed.

 465. frigidus: it is possible that
 this is an allusion to teachings of
 Empedocles (who was a physicist),
 in which he identified life with
 heat. But the allusion would be
 rather obscure. It is more likely
 to be ‘in cold blood,’ for the oon-
 trast with ardentem.

 467. idem . . . occidenti: ‘does
 the same thing as killing him ’ ; i.e.,
 it is just as bad to prevent him
 from dying when he wants to die,
 as to kill him when he wants to
