PREFACE.

All manuals of instruction on the Melodeon published up to this time do not answer the
requirements of sacred music in the Catholic churches of America. They are either not at all in—
tended for ecclesiastical music, but only for the parlor, —- and many of these contain exercises
altogether foreign to the peculiar character of the instrument — or they presuppose the knowledge
of the Piano-Forte, which we are not justiﬁed to do in this country; or, ﬁnally, they are only pre-
paratory to a course on the pipe-organ, and consequently imperfect. The large majority of our
churches and chapels have as yet no pipe-organ, but only a melodeon. Hence our efforts this
"Theory and Praxis of Melodeon-playing“ intended in an especial manner for divine service, will not
be in vain; for a long—felt want of such a book will be supplied thereby.

The IM or theoretical part of these instructions does not presuppose any knowledge of
music; for it - begins with the rudiment of notation, and leads the pupil progressively to such a
degree of perfection as every ”organist“ ought to attain. Moreover the most necessary information
on the structure of the instrument, on notation, keys, ﬁngering and so forth, has been given in a
simple and concise style. Yet it will be found comprehensive enough to answer all demands ‘of a
diligent student.

The 2‘1 or practical part contains a selection of over 300 short and long pieces in all major
and minor keys, as well as in the old church-modes, all of which may be used during divine
service, and as exercises. In order to aid the understanding of music, some'remarks on the most
ordinary forms of organ-composition have been added. The last chapter contains the liturgical
ordinances concerning the use of the organ in church. ·

The appendix contains the accompaniment to all responsorios of Mass and Vespers, to all

q prefaces in the solemn and ferial tones, to the different modes of the psalms and their usual trans-

positions, and to the Adsperges, Vidi aquam, Veni Creator, O salutan's, Tantum ergo —— a supplement
which will prove necessary to many, desirable to all.

I am indebted to Messrs. Herzog, Oberhoffer, Piel and Mettenleiter for their permission
to make use of their compositions for, and works on the Melodeon Thanks to both composers and
publisher!

FIRST PART.
s. 1.

The Melodeon is a keyed instrument, externally resembling the Organ or Piano. Its tones are
produced by the vibration of metallic reeds. The latter are oblong, thin and movable plates of a brasslike
composition, having one end ﬁxed and the other lying over, so as to be agitated by a current of air from a
bellows. The vibrating plate (lamina or tongue) produces the tone. If the plate is long and thick at the
free end, its vibrations are fewer and its tone deep; if the reverse, its faster vibrations produce an acute tone.
The reeds or tongues are placed in several rows on the upper part of the bellows. The free end of every
tongue is within a narrow aperture, beneath which, in the interior of the bellows, there are valves, i. e. close
lids faced with soft leather. These valves close the above-mentioned apertures (cancelli) air-tight by the pres-
sure of springs, and they are opened by touching the keys.

A series of tongues, which corresponds to the whole number of keys on the ﬁnger-board, is called a
register. If a melodeon has one, two, three etc. such complete rows of tongues, it is accordingly called an
instrument with one, two, three etc. registers. Each register is contained in so called chambers closed up by
horizontal doors; the chambers are opened by draw-knobs, called stops, handily adapted above the ﬁnger-board.

The tongues are caused to vibrate by the in-ﬂowing air and thus the tones are produced. A supply
of air is forced out of the bellows, which are made to work by an alternate pressure on the two pedals.
If this pressure is strong and repeated in short intervals the air is forced out with greater vehemence and
accordingly the volume of tone increases; if it is weak and slow, the smaller amount of air produces a
softer tone.

In order to direct a current of air into a certain register, the corresponding stop must be pulled.
But as each register is divided into two halves, two stops which however bear different names, must be
pulled to open the whole register; one of these two stops is intended for the upper keys (Treble), the other
for the lower ones (Bass). Then, upon touching a key, the valve beneath the aperture is opened, the air
forced out of the bellows gains access to the tongue and causes it to vibrate and sound.

After these brief remarks on the construction of a melodeon, the ﬁrst requirement is the knowledge
of the musical signs or notes, by which the keys to be touched are pointed out.

Notes Staﬁ'. Ledger Lines.

Notes are signs indicating musical sounds. They are marked on and between the lines of a
staff which consists of 5 parallel lines and 4 spaces.

Tones, which exceed the above 9 degrees on the staff, are indicated by small auxiliary or ledger

I lines below or above the staff.

Names of Notes. Glefs.

The names of the notes (degrees) are c, d, e, f, g, ιι, b — the musical alphabet. In this series of
Wire notes, c indicates the lowest tone, and each successive note is by one degree higher than the one
immediately preceding. The different degrees of the staff are named according to the position of the clef,
a sign placed in the beginning of a line, which determines the name of the note on that line; thence the rest
of the notes are easily found. — Three clefs are used in our instructions, viz:

The G- or Treble-clef on the second line: E; it indicates that the note on the

 

second line is called 9. a

The F- or Bass-clef on the fourth line: E; indicating, that the note on the
fourth line is called f. f __

The successive notes ‹·. d, c. f, g. a, b, ‹·—, which are called octave (became they are all within the com-

known by the following distinctive names: Counter-octave. great and small octaves, single-lined, double-
line-i, triple-lined octaves.

g. 6.
Measure.

By measure we understand an equal division of notes and rests. One of the diﬁ‘erent kinds
of notes — a minim, crotchet or quaver etc. — is set down as the unit-note. Accordingly every note or rest
counts as many time-parts or beats, as the unit is contained in it. If, for instance, the crotchet is taken for
the unit, a Semibreve contains 4, a Minim 2, a crotchet 1 time-part. The measure is marked in the beginning
of a. piece, next to the clef. Every measure has a certain number of time-parts equally distributed on several
sections, which are separated by vertical lines. Both these sections and the separating lines are called bars.

Bars:

ä

The most common measures are the following:

 

A. Simple even measures:

The two-quarter (crotchet) measure: The two-half (minim) measure: E or
the small Allabreve-measure, also marked thus:

' B. Simple triple measures:

The three-quarter measure The three-eighth (quaver) measure
The three half measure

C. Compound even measures:

The four-quarter measure: ᾗ or also called Common measure, marked thus:

The four-half measure: The four-eighth measure:

D. Compound triple measures:

The six-quarter measure: . The six-eighth measure:

Every note or rest counts as many of these time-parts or beats, as the unit-note (1],, Ἰ, or 1/s) is
contained in it. '

§. 7.
'The Keyboard. Names of the Keys.

The Keyboard consists of lower white keys and upper black ones. Each of these keys is named
according to the note which is made to sound by touching it. The black keys are placed side by side in
alternate groups of two and three. Every lower key at the left of two black keys is called c and the sub-
sequent lower keys are d, e, f, g, a, b, c. Thus the names of the lower keys are repeated like the names
of the notes.

Let the pupil now try to ﬁnd the keys corresponding to the notes he learned thus far. — In order
to facilitate the reading of the keys, we add a view of the whole keyboard containing the corresponding notes
below, and the names of the upper keys above the ﬁnger-board:

g. 8.

Position of the Body and Fingers. Style of Playing.

Let the pupil sit straight and easy in front of the middle of the keyboard. The stool must be
high enough to level the elbows of the player with the keyboard. The upper arm should slant down free
and unconstrained; the forearm should take a horizontal position, so that the wrist, the middle of the hand,
and the ﬁrst phalanges of the ﬁngers form a straight line; the middle phalanges should be oblique and the
last perpendicular, without however allowing the nails to touch the keys. The thumb is stretched out straight
and covers so much of the key as to avoid its slipping off. Each ﬁnger should touch the surface of its key
exactly in the center. Special Care must be taken, lest the hands he held too high or slanting towards
the little finger; in short, all positions which, by the weight of the hand, render the free action
of the fingers impossible, must be avoided. 'The knuckles should not stand forth; the wrist must be
loose and ﬂexible; the hands, arms and the whole body of the player should be in a natural and
unconstrained position and remain quiet and at rest as much as possible.

Let the player touch the keys quietly and softly, but at the same time ﬁrmly and without lingering.
The keys must be pressed down entirely, in order that the tone may sound clear and complete at once.

The keys must be kept down exactly as long, as the value of the notes demands. By removing the
ﬁngers from the keys too soon, the proper connection of tones will be broken up and the music will sound
”ragged“. On the contrary, a slow and tardy m0vement of te ﬁngers will cause a medley of tones disagreeable
to the ear. Hence the ﬁnger must allow the key to rebound with the same exactness, as it was touched.

The feet of the player must both be engaged in moving the two pedals continually up and down.
Let the feet be placed so that the heels are supported by the brazen borders of the pedals.

The pedals must be moved alternately, but always to the bottom of the case and steadily, never
abruptly, in order that the tones produced may be of a full and equal volume. Sudden breaks or interruptions
in the pressure on the pedals produce an unnatural and broken tone. One foot begins its pressure on the
pedal shortly before the other has completed it. As soon as the air is thus forced out entirely, the foot 'must
be at once withdrawn, in order that the bellows may be reﬁlled with air. A faster or slower action of the feet
produces a stronger or softer tone. Before the pupil commences to play, he ought to learn how to use the
pedals in a proper manner. Unnecessary haste, half-way or even shorter movements of the pedals, and above
all violence should be carefully avoided.

Singenberger, Kowloon-playing. Ι 2

6 First Part.

The style of playing a melodeon must be, like that of an organ, strictly legato (smooth, gliding),
that is to say: The duration of the tones must exactly correspond to the entire value of the notes; therefore
the keys must be kept down neither too long nor too short a time, in order to avoid both an unharmonious
medley of tones and uncalled-for breaks or interruptions.

For this purpose the proper use of the ﬁngers, called fingering, is of the greatest importance.
The principal rule is the- following: Always have fingers free for the keys to be touched next. In
order to carry out this rule, we have to resort to different modes of ﬁngering: 1. Substitution, or changing
ﬁngers on the same key. — 2. Passing, or moving some ﬁnger over the thumb, or the thumb under some
ﬁnger. —— 3. Slide, or moving the same ﬁnger smoothly from an upper to a lower key and vice versa, or from
one key, blak or white. to the next. — 4. Distributition, or dividing a series of notes conveniently between
both hands. In the subsequent exerciset these directions concerning the ﬁngering ought to be most carrefully
attended to. In order to accustom the pupil to a correct ﬁngering, the ﬁrst part of this book contains ﬁgures
above the notes to point out a ﬁnger of the right hand, and below the notes to direct the left hand. Every
key, therefore, must be touched by those ﬁngers only, which are pointed out. The thumb of each hand is marked
by the ﬁgure +; 1 signiﬁes the index, 2 the middle ﬁnger, 3 the ring-ﬁnger, 4 the little ﬁnger.

e. 9.
Play mm, hineipal Rules for Practiserg,

Divide every piece into different sections, not too long, and practise each of them singly!

Repeat difficult passages very often!

Count the beats loud, that you may learn how to keep time! Read what is to be practised,
before playing: the notes, their value, the corresponding keys, the ﬁngering!

Mind all signs of execution and be sure to understand their meaning!

Accustom the eye to rest on the notes to be played, not on the keys!

Play strictly legato and according to the exact value of the notes!

Do not deviate from the given fingering!

For the following exercises only two stops, Diapason and Melodie, are to be pulled.

In order to avoid too many ledger lines, a note of the lower staff is often transposed from the F-clef
into the G-clef. So, in the above exercise, the last note of the left hand has been transposed; nevertheless it
is to be played with the left hand.

g. 12.
Tempo

By tempo or time we understand the rate of movement in counting the time-parts (beats)
of a measure. The tempo is marked in the beginning of a piece above the upper staff, but frequently it is
changed in the course of playing. If no tempo be given, a moderately fast movement is understood. Let the
pupil count slowly in the beginning but he ought to repeat a piece so often, as to adapt the movement to the
prescribed tempo. The most usual terms relating to the rate of movement, are these:

Largo = broad, protracted.
Grave = grave, serious.

‚ _ Very slow tempo.
Lento = slow, lmgermg.

 

Adagio = slow.

Larghetto = less slow than Largo.

Andante = less slow than Adagio. Ι Slow tempo.
Andantz‘no = a little faster than Andante.

Moderato = moderate.

Maestoso = solemn, with grandeur. I Middling tempo.
Allegretto = somewhat lively.

Allegro moderato = moderately fast.

Allegro = lively.

Allegro am fuoco = ﬁery. ι Fast tempo.
Allegro con brio = spirited.

Allegro assai = very lively.

Viv‘we = sprightly‘ ’ | Very fast tempo.
&esto = fast.

Prestissimo = fastest.

These indications of time are often modiﬁed by the following adverbs:

assai = very. meno = less.
molto = much, very. un pooo = a little.

troppo = very. piu moto or mosso = more lively.
non troppo = not too much. meno mosso = less lively.
piu = more. poco a poco = little by little.

A gradual acceleration of movement is indicated thus:

accelerando = growing faster and faster.
stringendo = urging onward.
piu stretto = hastening.

A gradual transition into a slower movement is signiﬁed by such terms as:

ritemoto (rit.) = holding back. calando = decreasing in movement and volume of tone.
ritardando (ritard.) = slackening. a tempo or tempo primo = former strict time.
rallentamlo (rallent.) = slower and slower. l'istesso tempo = the same time.

Since, however, these indications of time are rather vague and liable to divers interpretations, the rate
of movement is more exactly determined by Maelzel’s time-measurer, called Metronome (M. M. means
Maelzel’s Metronome). The pendulum of this instrument may be adjusted by a sliding weight, which,

Singenberger, Kowloon-playing. 4

14 First Part.

according to its place on a scale of 160 degrees, causes the pendulum to vibrate faster or slower. If, for
instance, the sliding weight (nut) is placed 'on 60°, the pendulum makes 60 swings in a minute and each swing
points out the duration of the unit-note. The following ﬁgures indicate the different rates of movement

ἵ.. ” approximately:

M. M J: 50 ( 50 crotchets in a minute) for the slowest movement.

,, ,, J: 60 ( 60 ,, ,, ,, ,, ) for the slow movement.
J = 90 ( 9O ,, ,, ,, . ,, ) for the moderately fast movement.
J: 120 (120 ,, ,, ,, ,, ) for the fast movement.

,, ,, 4|: 145—160. (145-160 „ „ „ „ ) for the fastest movement.

We see from this, that each one of the above movements has a compass of several degrees; e. g. the
slow tempo has 30°, since the moderately fast tempo begins with the 90“I degree. The exact rate of move-
ment is ﬁxed by the character of the piece.

Accented and Unaccented Parts of a Bar. Syncope.

The time-parts of a bar are partly accented, partly unaccented; the former are also called strong,
the latter weak time-parts. Simple measures have always and only the ﬁrst part accented, and the accents
of compound measures are determined by the simple measures: Quadruple measures (‘15, 4/4‚ 4In) have two
accented parts, viz. the 1't and 3“. Sextuple measures (‘75, o/„ Ἃ) have either two accented parts, viz. the
1't and 4‘“ or three, viz. 1", 3d and 5m, according as they are composed of two triple measures (2X 3/s‚ 2>< “l“
2 >< 8/„) or of three double measures (3 >< m, 3 X Ἄ, 8 >< m). If an unaccented time-part is tied to the
next accented one, the accent is laid on the ﬁrst of the two notes, though it is a weak part. Such an anti-
cipation of the accent is called Syncope; e. g. in the 7‘11 bar of N0. 37.

§. 14.
Sharps, Flats and Naturals

The sharp (if) placed before a note raises it by a semitone and indicates, that the next black or
white key to the right must be played; the name of the note remains the same with the addition ”sharp“.
For instance, the ἥ before f makes it f sharp; its key is the black one between f and g.

The flat (b) lowers the note by a semitone and indicates that the next key to the left must be
played. The note is then read by its proper name with the addition ”ﬂat“.

The Natural (H) signiﬁes that the note is restored to its former pitch.

These signs affect all notes of the same name in one bar, unless they are recalled. If, however,
they are marked at the beginning of a piece, between clef and measure, they are valid for all notes
of the same name in the whole piece. In the latter case, they are called the signature of a piece; in
the former, accidentals.

In the 2d, 4“, 6‘h and 7tll bars of the following exercise f sharp is to be played instead of fl

Loud and Still Substitution of Fingers.

Since the legato style of playing is essential to the organ, it is of the greatest importance to
learn, how to change ﬁngers on the same key, which we call substitution. Is is styled lond, when the
same key is to be touched anew, (compare the 3d and 5"I lower bars of No. 53), still, when the key remains
pressed down, while one ﬁnger is replaced by another. This is indicated in the ﬁngering by a tie over the

Dots above or below notes indicate that they are to be played in a short, pointed and distinct
manner, expressed by the musical term Staccato. The key is not kept down according to the entire value
of the note, but it is made to rebound immediately after the pressure; the remaining time due to the note is
taken up by a short pause. The opposite style of playing is expressed by the term Legato and indicated by
a slur above or below the notes. Wherever there is no sign, the Legato is understood.

The Scale. Major Scale. Triad.

By 9. Scale or Gamut we unterstand a series of seven successive tones, arranged by measured inter-
vals. The ﬁrst tone of a scale is called tonic or key-note and it gives every scale u distinctive name.
Therefore, the series c, d, e, f, g, a b is called the C—scale, because c is the fundamental tone or tonic. The
7"l tone of the ascending scale is called subtonic or also the leading tone, because it leads to the eigth
degree or octave, which, though it is only a repetition of the tonic, must be added for the sake of u satis-

factory termination of the scale. The C-scale consists of 5 tones“ and 2 semitones. The intervals between
c an d, d and e, f and g, g and a, a and b have each an intermediate tone, (compare the black keys of the
ﬁnger-board), whereas e and f, b und c have none. Hence the distance between e and f, b and c is the smallest
musical interval, which we call a semitone; the remaining 5 intervals are called tones. A scale which con-
sists of 5 tones and 2 semitones, is called diatonic. If, however, the intermediate tones are added, we obtain
a series of 12 semitones, the socalled chromatic scale. A diatonic scale having the 2 semitones from the

3‘1 to the 4‘h and from the '7‘h to the 8“I degrees, is called a Major scale. E. g.

These and the following exercises may also serve as an illustration to the remarks made on ﬁngering
(extension of ﬁngers).

 

Musical compositions or parts of them, in which the constituent tones of the 0-major scale are pre-
vailing, are said to be written in the 0-major key;

‘ The word "tone" is, here and in other places, used to signify the interval between two successive notes. Webster
remarks: "There is evident incongruity in using tone for indicating the interval between tones. As the word scale is derived
from the Italian scala, a ladder, the intervals may well be called "steps". But the use of tone in the meaning of step is commonly
almost universal". (Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary).

The Minor Scale

is distinguised from the major scale by the different position of its semitones. Every major scale has its
parallel minor scale, the tonic of which is found a tone and a semitone (11/, tones) below the tonic of the
major scale. The semitones of the diatonic minor scale are from the 2d to the 3d and from the 5th to the
6"I degrees. Hence the degrees of the minor scale, parallel to 0-major, are:
1 ¹ 1 1 ¹ 1 1
α, III/£0, d, efﬁf. 9, a
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.~
Moreover, we distinguish between the harmonic and the melodic minor scale; the former has the
7tll degree of the diatonic scale sharped, thus containing three semitones on the 2—3, 5—6 and 7—8 degrees.
The latter has the 6"I and 7“I degrees sharped, but only when ascending; descending, it equals the diatonic scale.
The following scale is to be playsd in a threefold manner:

     
 

 

1“, without any sharp = the diatonic minor scale.
2‘115, with g” only = the harmonic minor scale.
3‘119, ascending with Τῇ and μῆ, descending without any sharp = the melodic minor scale.

Transpaciﬁc: of the Scale.

Both the major and minor scales may be begun on any one note, in other words, they may be
transposed to any pitch. Yet, the tonic being once fixed, the different intervals must be conformed to those
of the primitive scales of 0-major and A-minor. But this can be effected only by sharping and ﬂatting certain
notes, which are pointed out by the signature (fl or b) at the beginning of a piece. The sharps or ﬂats,
forming the signature, inﬂuence all notes of the same name throughout the whole piece, unless they are recalled
by a natural h. '

Dynamics. Dynamical Signs.

The notes indicate only the pitch and duration of tones; their different degrees of force, however,
which are called dynamics, are indicated by special signs called dynamical signs. These signs must be
considered as an essential part of a composition, without which it is impossible to perform a piece with the
proper expression. Let the pupil, therefore, study the meaning of the following dynamical signs, which occur
most frequently:

p = piano = with a soft or low sound. f = forte = with a loud sound.
pp = pianissimo = with a sound softer than piano. ff = fortissimo = with a sound louder than forte.
mf = meno forte = with a moderately loud sound. pf = poco forte = with a sound louder than piano.
rs = m'nforeando = with force and emphasis on a single tone; the same is expressed by marcato.
sf = sforzando = a higher degree of rs.
cresc. = crescendo (-<) = with a gradual increase of volume.
decresc. = decre-§cendo (>-) = with a gradual decrease of volume.
dim. = diminuendo = with a gradual decrease to m).
-< >- = messa di voce = with a gradual increase followed by a gradual decrease.
morendo or smorecmdo = dying away.
perpendoso = losing itself (the tone).
cal. = calando = growing slower and softer.
1ο*

40 First Part.

Besides these terms also the following words are often used to modify the performances
Amabüe = lovely, pleasing. Pompom = grand.

Animato = spirited. Iamentoso = plaintively.
Con bria = with fire. funebre = gravely.
Dolce = softly, sweetly. Cantabile = in a melodious, ﬂowing style.

Risoluto = ﬁrmly.

These various degrees of force in music are to the ear that which light and shade in painting are to
the eye. It requires indeed great care and patience to give due attention to this variety of dynamical degrees,
yet, by neglecting them we deprive music of its beauty and efﬁcacy.

The following directions are to show how the pupil ought to perform a piece dynamically correct.

1. A fast movement of the pedals produces a loud tone, a slow movement a soft tone. Add to this,
that the playing of a passage consisting of full chords requires a greater quantity of air and consequently a
fast movement of the pedals.

2. The Crescendo is produced by moving the pedals gradually faster; the Decrescendo, by moving the
pedals gradually slower.

Most of the Amercan melodeons have a socalled swell, which is attached above the pedals as high as
the knee of the player. Upon pressing the knee against the swell, the volume of the tone is gradually in-
creased, provided that, at the same time, the pedals are moved faster. The proper use of the swell requires
careful exercise, as every pressure of the knee more or less strong produces at once an audible change in the
volume of tone. Therefore, the pupil must try and try again to move the pedals and the swell in such a
manner, that a smooth and even tone is produced. For this reason, the pressure on the swell as well as on
the pedals must be quiet and even, and it must he repeated fast or slow according to the required volume of
tone. This exercise must be repeated again and again, until the pupil is able to sustain a chdrd in all degrees
. of force as long as he wants. — Begin with playing the following notes ﬂrt p, then pp, mf, f.

Now, let the same exercise be repeated with some additional stops and ﬁnally with all stops. Many
melodeons, principally larger ones, are furnished with a mechanism similar to the swell on the opposite side.
It yields also to a presure of the left knee and thus opens all registers at once, while the stops remain un-
touched. Such a mechanism is called Grand Organ. Other instruments have a special stop for the same purpose

It would be well to repeat the previous exercises with an application of dynamical sign, as they are
given in the subsequent pieces.

It may not be superﬂuous to remark here, that the use of the swell hould not be turned into an abuse
by applying it constantly and without any reason whatsoever. That would be mawkish aﬂ'ectation, a style of
playing which means nothing and disgusts the bearer, especially during divine service. A judicious observance
of dynamics infuses, as it were, a soul into the lifeless notes, and therefore, it cannot be called sentimentality.

44 First Part.

The Comma 9 or short vertical line I, which, in vocal music, is frequently used as a sign of breathing,
is also employed in instrumental music, and indicates that certain notes are to be distinctly separated by a
very short interruption, not unlike the pause which a reader makes at a comma in recitation.

g. 24.
Triplets

The value of a note has thus far always been divided into two halves, e. g. semibreve (whole)
= 2 minims (halves), a minim = 2 crotchets, a crotchet = 2 quavers etc. Yet there exists also a triparti-
tion of a note, e. g. A semibreve = 3 minims, a minim = 3 crotchets, a crotchet = 3 quavers etc. Such
groups of 3 notes are called triplets. They are divided according to the value of the notes into triplets of
minims, triplets of crotchets, qnavers etc. and are indicated by the ﬁgure 3 placed above or below such
groups of notes. The ﬁgure 3 is, however, frequently omitted, since, in most cases, a triplet is easily distinguished
from other notes. As to the value, a triplet equals two notes os the same kind or the one, from which it is
derived by tripartition.

Embellishments.

Although organ-compositions are comparatively seldom ornamented with so-called embellishments, yet
the pupil must know the manner of writing and performing them on account of the few which occur.

1. Appoggiatura, or leaning note, placed before the principal note and taking half the time of the
principal note.

These brief remarks on embellishments or graces will sufﬁce for our purpose. The performance must,
of course, be very smooth, distinct and quick; if not, they are anything but embellishments. Special attention
must be paid to the precise lifting of the ﬁngers and an even and rapid succession of tones.

The mark eva (octava) over a note or series of notes indicates that the notes, over which it is extended,
are raised by an octave. If the same mark is placed under the notes, they are lowered by an octave. The
term "loco" recalls the above mark and indicates that the notes have again their original pitch.

Now, we return to the different transpositions of the major and minor scales, as they succeed one
another. Let the pupil practise them together with the repetition of the previous exercises, and before
beginning to practise the subsequent pieces of the respective key. A frequent practice of the scales will aid
the pupil to surmount the technical difﬁculties, and to acquire a smooth and even style of playing. Moreover,
the scales afford a very useful exercise in regard to dynamics, if, for instance, the ascending scale is performed
crescendo, the descending, decrescendo, then again legato or staccato, p and pp, or ms and f.

Performance.

It is not sufﬁcient to perform a composition technically correct, but the main requisite of an
artistic performance is the understanding and appreciation of the beauties contained in a composition. Hence
the performer must endeavor to penetrate into the spirit of a composition, to comprehend the ideas and the
individual feeling of the composer, and to reproduce them in his own performance with all the means at his
disposal. This faculty cannot be taught; it requires musical talent and a fine taste, which alone will
enable the performer to study and ﬁnally comprehend the ideas expressed in a composition. In short, music
cannot be taught by drilling, but by developing that gift of nature which we call musical
talent. The variou emotions of the composer are intimated principally by the peculiarities of the key,
tempo and dynamical niceties (shading), as well as by the different timbres of sound and their com-
binations. In order to inculcate the proper meaning of a composition, and to facilitate the artistic performance,
modern composers are wont to add numerous directions for the performer, such as tempo, dynamics etc. The
pupil ought to observe these indications accurately, in order to reproduce the! composers work completely
in his own performance. On tempo and dynamics we have already given the necessary information. But there
is another means of the greatest importance for an artistic performance, a means by which the performer is
enabled to produce a great variety of timbres and combinations thereof on the melodeon and, to a still greater
extent, on the organ: it is the judicious use and tasteful combination of the different registers.

. 29.
Registefs and Steps.

It is a great mistake to judge from the number of stops, that there must be an equal number of
registers or sets of reeds. The long row of stops are but too often a mere show and swindle, by which
people who have no insight, are imposed upon. A register or a complete set of reeds, corresponding to the
compass of the key-board, has two stops. Besides, there are steps which do not cause any change of timbre,
but only a slight increase in the volume of sound. “’ ’

Ξ ἐξ

1. Sounding stops.

According to the different pitches of sound, we speak of eight-foot, four-foot, two-foot,‘_‘sixteen-foot
stops. The 8ft. stops produce the normal pitch of sound, the lowest sound being F of the counter octave

g. 28. Artistic Performance. §. 29. Registers and Stops. §. 30. Combination of stops. 55

(on instruments with a compass of only four octaves, it is great 0'); every key sounds the pitch indicated
by the note. 4ft. stops make the keys sound one octave higher than indicated by the notes; 2ft. stops two
octaves higher, and 16ft. stops one octave lower. Hence if 4ft stops are to produce the same pitch as 8ft.
stops, those keys which are one octave lower than indicated by the notes, must be touched; with 16 it. stops,
one octave higher. The list below contains the stops in common use, together with their pitches as we ﬁnd
them on melodeons with one key-board.

Those who have the means to procure an instrument with two rows of keys, called, manuals and even
with foot-keys, do better, if they buy a pipe-organ of small dimensions, which both in volume of tone and
durability surpasses the largest melodeon.

_ As to the stops, the instruments of different ﬁrms vary some times in the nomenclature and arrange-
ment of stops; but that will be easily discerned by examining and hearing them.

Stops with 8ft. sound:

Diapason for the Bass — Melodie for the Treble.
Voce jubilante ,, ,,

Grand Solo
Bassoon ,, ,, ,, Hautboy
Cor anglais ,, ,, ,, Flute

Stops with 4ft. sound:
Viola for Bass — Flute for Treble.
Violetta ,, ,, Celeste ,,
Principal „ „
Stops with 16ft. sound:
Sub Bass from 0 to c, on larger instrument from C’ to e.
Bourdon from the deepest F to e; Clarinet or Clarionet for Treble. Saxophone for Treble.

2. Silent Stops.

Vox humana — a kind of fan-wheel, by the revolving motion of which the sound becomes smooth
and wavy, intended to imitate the human voice.

Tremolo — a stop never to be used in sacred music; and even otherwise it is a mere nuisance,
ofensive to a musical ear.

Octave Coupler — a contrivance, by which the octave of a key is pressed down together with the
key touched, to produce an increase in volume of sound.

Forte —— a stop intended to cause a slight increase of volume.

The knee-swell and grand organ have been spoken of in a previous chapter.

g. 30.

Combination of stops.

By combination of stops we mean the art of selecting the proper mixture of stops for—the sake of
producing a certain timbre of sound. It is, certainly, a matter of careful study to make such combinations as
suit the peculiar character of a piece. As a rule, the performer must pull two stops belonging together at a
time. For mere accompaniment, those stops producing soft tones will answer best Both the pulling and the
pushing of stops ought to be done skillfully and quickly, and, as much as possible, by force of the ﬁngers only.

In compositions for the melodeon, the stops wanted are frequently indicated by the initials enclosed
in parenthesis; e. g. (D) = Diapason, (M) = Melodia, (FL) = Flute, and so forth. When these indications
have an oblique stroke across them, they signify the closing or pushing back of the respective stop;
a. g. (D) denotes the closing of Diapason; the same is indicated by the initials enclosed in brackets, e. g. [D].
Those indications marked over the upper staff are intended for the treble, those under the lower staff for the

bass, and those between the two staves for both treble and bass.

§. 31.

Preservation of the instrument Repairs.

The melodeon may be im'ured by damp weather, draught, dry heat, and dust. Therefore, the instru-
ment ought not to stand near a stove, nor close to a damp wall, nor in a place which exposes it to the rays
of the sun. The steps must be closed, in order to keep the dust from the reeds. Care must be taken not to
iniure the instrument by a violent and abrupt pressure on the pedals and keys. Occasional disturbances of the
instrument should be attended to and repaired without delay. Many defects may be easily repaired.

If a key sounds without being touched, the corresponding valve does not close the aperture admitting
air to the tongue. The causes of this defect may be as follows: The key is prevented from rebounding by
friction. I know cases where, in consequence of damp weather, the frame in front of the key-board was bent
a little towards the keys, which on this account were prevented from rebounding. A slight abrasion of the
frame removed the obstacle. — Frequently also the valve does not close the aperture air-tight, because it is
covered with dust, or because the spring attached to the valve has lost part of its elasticity. Sometimes the
spring is detached from the valve by striking the keys too violently, or the valve is stopped by a small nail
close by it, especially when it opens too far. In many such cases we can easily readjust the valve by repeated
short touches of the key; generally, however, we have to open the chamber, (every one ought to have this ’
explained by the manufacturer or merchant, when he buys the instrument) in order to readjust the valve.

If a tongue does not sound, brush the dust from it. Open the chamber, pull out the tongue with
the incised wire, which is found in every instrument, put a slip of paper under it, and clean it with a soft
brush. Do all this carefully and the tongue will sound again.

The tongues are put out of tune either by dust or by abreak. In the former case clean the
tongue, in the latter buy a new one. In ordering a new tongue give the name or number of the instrument,
or at least the name of the register, note and octave. In order to be sure of having the tongue tuned well,
send the tongue next to it along with the order.

The rattling of a tongue occurs, when it is loose and its edges are exposed to friction, -- which
rarely happens. Pull out the tongue and ﬁle the edges a little, but so as not to break it.

As to the rest, is is advisable to consult a manufacturer of instruments in order not to make the
num worse.

g. 32.

Modulation

By modulation we understand the transition from one key into another. The art of modulating
forms part of Harmony, the study of which is indispensably necessary to complete the musical training of an
organist. Yet, since a good many of our organists, notwithstanding the great number of good manuals of
instruction on this point, ﬁnd no opportunity of making a thorough course in Harmony, I have deemed it
advisable to append a synopsis of very brief and simple modulations from all keys into all keys, in order to
lessen somewhat the frequent and gross mistakes made in modulating. Each modulation is followed by a short
cadence, which is to make the transition into the new key satisfactory and pleasing to the musical ear. Let
the pupil commit them to memory!

All accidentals in parenthesis are to be observed only when the modulation is to be made from one
minor key into another. In this case, all other notes are to be played according to the signature given for

_ the major key.

A brief survey of the Forms of Organ-compositions

There are in music, according to the analogy of language, various forms of expressing, or modes
of exhibiting musical ideas. Every composition consists of several movements (these again of periods, sections,
phrases, and so forth) which, according to their different number, arrangement and connection, constitute dif-
ferent styles and forms.

A. The homophonous style, in which the principal idea of the piece is expressed by one part, while the
others are subordinate to, and form the accompaniment of the one main part.

B. The polyphonic style, in which all parts, or at least more than one are coordinate, i. e. they have
each their own melodic development and partake equally of the ideas expressed by the whole; hence
each part is an essential or real part of the whole.

The homophonous style is more simple and easier to comprehend, whereas the polyphonic style is more
expressive and more thoroughly penetrated by the musical idea of a composition.

Both styles are employed in sacred music.

The principal forms of the polyphonic style are:

1. Imitation. A motive, i. e. a model, consisting of two or more tones, is repeated in one part, while
that part which introduces the model, continues its own melody. If the imitation retains the same
degrees of tone, and the same progression of intervals, it is termed strict imitation. Free imi-
tations, however, are those, in which the model is repeated on different degrees and in slightly
changed intervals.

Examples of imitation are found among the preceding exercises and, especially, among the subsequent
compositions of those mediaevalmasters who are renowned for their unsurpassed skill in working out a
theme (thematic work): May their works he studied with exceeding diligence and perseverance.

. 2. The Canon. Each part contains exactly the same motive, which, however, is begun in different bars,
or, at least, on diﬁ'erent timeparts of'a bar.

3. The Fugue, a composition in which a longer motive, called theme, is imitated by all parts in a suc-
cession, determined by the precepts of musical aesthetics. After the first passage, a second one fol-
lows, conuected with the ﬁrst by an episode. In the second passage, the theme frequently appears'in
divers melodic and rhythmic alterations: inverted, augmented or diminished. Towards the end of a fugue,

’ all parts repeat the theme in close succession, that is to say, one part sets in before the preceding part
has ﬁnished the theme: this is called a close passage. It is generally executed on the so-called
Organ-point, i. e. on a sustained tone in the bass-part. Cfr. No. 195. A anhetta or short fugue
contains only one passage of the theme. Cfr. No. 70.

The principal form of the homophonous style is the song-form, which consists of one or two periods;
each period containing two phrases akin to each other. — Another form of the homophonous style is
the variation.

A Prelude is a long or short introductory composition to another movement (e. g. fugue), song, or
action. The character and key of preludes must agree with the following movement or with the character of
a feast. The same must be said about postludes and interludes. Versetto (strophe) is a term ﬁar those
interludes, which are to supply those parts of a song which are not sung by the choir.

Toccata is a composition without strict form, something like a fantasia, containing long-sustained
chords set to a lively ﬁguration. “

Here follow some longer and more difﬁcult compositions.

§. 34.

The ancient Church-modes.

In the peculiar chant of the Church, called Gregorian, or Plain Chant, there are not only two,
diatonic scales, the major and minor scales of modern music, but each one of the seven constituent tones of
the scale may be taken as the ﬁrst, or tonic. Hence we distinguish seven scales different from one another
by the position of the semitones. The knowledge of these scales is indispensably necessary for the organist,
because he has to accompany the melodies of plain chant, and furnish preludes and interludes in the same
mode.. It is for this reason, that we append a synopsis of the scales and modes, and selection of short and
easy compositions in all modes. Moreover, these compositions afford an opportunity of studying this style of
music, and of admiring, even in shortest passages, the musical art and genius displayed by the composers.

The scales based on d, e, f, g, α and c are called authentic modes. The ﬁrst tone of each scale is
the tonic, the ﬁfth tone is the dominant ("the ruling tone“), except in the scale constructed on e, in which
the sixth tone is the dominant. Every authentic mode has its corresponding plagal mode which begins four
degrees below the tonic. Hence, in the plagal modes, the tonic is on the fourth degree, the dominant on the
third above the tonic, except in the 4⁰² and 8“l scales, where the dominant is on the fourth degree above the
tonic. Compare the following synopsis: Α

These modes indicated by odd ﬁgures are authentic; the rest, plagal modes. Observe the usual
transpositions subjoined to each mode. The curved lines point out the position of the semitones.

Ecclesiastical Ordinances Missing the use of the Organ.

1) On all Sundays and those feasts on which the faithful abstain from senile work, it beﬁts the
church, that the organ should be played and the chanting of musicians should be employed. c. Ep. I, c. 28.

2) On the Sundays of Advent and Lent, however, the organ should be silent, except on the 3 Sun- ,

day of Advent (”Gaudete“) and the 4s"I of Lent C’Laetare“), when the playing of the organ is permitted at
ss ngenhugu, Kowloon-playing. 45

178 Second Part. g. 35. Ecclesiastical Ordinances concerning the use of Organ.

High Mass and Vespers only, but not during the recital of the other Canonical Hours. It is, likewise, per-
mitted on all feast during Advent and Lent, and on those days which are solemnly celebrated by the Church,
6. g. on the feasts of St. Mathias, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Gregory the Great, St. Joseph, Annunciation of the
Blessed Virgin Mary etc; moreover, on Maundy Thursday at Mass, on Holy Saturday at Mass and Vespers,
and whenever the divine service is solemnised for some important motive of joy.

3) The organ may be played at Votive Masses de B. V. M. on the Saturdays of Advent and Lent,
and at the Litanies sung after Vespers.

4) Whenever the Bishop of the diocese enters a church in solemn procession either to perform the
divine service in person or to assist, and when he, afterwards, leaves the church, it is becoming to play the
organ. Likewise, at the solemn entrance of a Papal Envoy, Cardinal, Archbishop or Bishop of another diocese,
whom the Ordinary wishes to honor, the organ should be played, until the Prelate has ﬁnished prayers and
the service is to commence.

5) On feasts of higher rank, when the Matias are said in a solemn manner, the organ may be employed
from beginning to end, as at Vespers. Α

6) At Matins, Mass and Vespers, the ﬁrst and the last strophe or verses of Hymns and Canticles, as
well as those strophes or verses at which a genuﬂection is to be made, e. g. "Te ergo quaesumus“ in the Te
Deum, "Tantum ergo“, when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, and others, should be sung by the choir with
a distinct pronunciation of the words, but not merely supplied by the organ. The same rule applies to the

”Gloria Patti“, even though the verse or strophe immediawa preceding has been sung by the choir.
' 7) At other Canonical Hours, which are recited in choro, it is not customary m employ the organ.
But if such a custom exist anywhere, tho play the organ, for instance, at the Tierce, especially when the
Bishop, at the same time, puts on the sacred vestments, the custom may be kept up. Yet, it must be borne in
mind, that those parts which are not sung, but merely supplied by the organ, are to be distinctly recited by
one of the chanters. It is commendable that the organ should accompany the chanter’s recital.

8) At Solemn Vespers, the organ is usually played after every psalm, and alternately at the Hymns
and the ”Magniﬁcat“, the above mentioned rules being strictly observed.

9) During Solemn High Mass the organ is played alternately at the Kyrie, Gloria, Gradual, Sanctus
and Agnus Dei; then at the Oﬁ'ertory, and during the Consecration in softer and more solemn strains; ﬁnally
at the Communio, and at the end of Mass.

10) At the Credo, however, it is forbidden to supply alternate parts by the organ; but it must be
distinctly sung by the choir from beginning to end.

11) Care must be taken, lest the tunes of the organ become lascivious or sentimental, again, that the

. melodies and harmonies, far from being profane or indeeorous, agree with the character of the divine service;

other instruments beside the organ should not be employed.

12) Likewise, both the singers and musicians should take precautions, lest their singing which is
intended to promote piety, savour of levity or wantonness; let the music be such as not to divert the minds of
the listeners from prayer and pious contemplations; let it be devout, clear and intelligible.

13) In Masses and ofﬁces for de dead we employ neither the organ nor ﬁgured music, but only Plain
Chant which is also proper for the seasons of Advent and Lent. A precept to this effect refers especially to
the time from the 5“) Sunday of Lent to Easter, except Maundy Thursday and Holy Saturday. c. Ep.11.0.20,4

14) The use of the organ at Requiem-masses may be tolerated, but its tunes should be reserved and
suitable to the moumful character of the divine service. March 30, 1629. -

APPENDIX.

Shall the Gregorian chant in general, the Preface and Paternoster in Particular, be accompanied?

Time and again we are asked: Is the Gregorian chant to be accompanied by the organ? Let the
question he answered in whatever way, one thing is certain, there is no ecclesiastical decision against such
accompaniment. Considering the question from its historical and musical stand-points, any and every kind of
harmonization is to be rejected as an anachronistic and incongruous additamentum. The Gregorian chant
was conceived as mere melodies inspired by the sacred text, and not founded on certain harmonic tone com-
binations on which modern harmony is built; for harmony in the modern sense of the therm was unknown to
the ancient world. For that reason any harmonization of the Gregorian chant will always constitute an
unwarrantable garb marring its peculiar beauties rather than presenting them in their proper light. ’

From a practical point of view, however, a beﬁtting accompaniment by the organ will recommend itself,
be it for assisting the execution of the chant, be it on account of the paucity of singers, be it to prevent
tiresomeness on the part of the performers and to steady their voices, or for producing variety, always affording
pleasure and delight. At all events the accompaniment must be in keeping with" the characteristic peculiarities
of the ancient church tonalities that differ essentially from our modern major and minor keys; it is never allowed
to deviate from the melodic nature of the chant, its only object being the elucidation of the melody ensuring
an easy and ﬂowing declamation of the sacred text. — Though it may be allowed to accompany the Preface
and Pater noster still it would be better m omit them, from both musical and practical considerations. It not
unfrequently happens that the ofﬁciating priest sings them incorrectly, or his voice is faulty; in such cases an
accompaniment may cover many sins against clearness and beauty of the chant, still the dissonances caused
will‘harshly grate on the ears of the hearers. On the contrary, is the Preface sung correctly and with a sonorous
voice, many niceties will be destroyed; for 1) the organ-tone is of an uncouth and much less supple nature than
the human voice; 2) Are the chanters —- the priest and the organist — at too great a distance as to make it
possible for both to proceed simultaneously, as we all know from experience. In this wise, melody and harmony
are clashing and the effect far from producing an effect to edify the congregations or to enhance their devotion.

Moreover the Preface should always be sung ”intelligibili voce“‚ which is rendered impossible if the
organ accompaniment is too loud; ﬁnally, a temporary pause on the part of the organist is a veritable recrea-
tion, more conducive to true devotion than an uncessant dinning of sound, more particularly at a moment when
the oﬁ'ering priest intones that sublime, majestic hymnus requiring a frame of mind to which a dead instru-
ment, like the organ, by no means can do justice. From all these considerations, it is evident that the organ
accompaniment would better be omitted than executed: better none than incorrectness and inevitable diversion.

Conceive of an organist to whom both tonality and melody of the Preface are unknown quantities,

accompanying the oﬂiciating priest with an organ only in rare cases in time, how is it possible for the priest › -

to sing it correctly? Or the organist is running up and down the keyboard as if in a rage, what kind of
nerves must the priest possess in order to proceed lcomposedly with a melody the most solemn, sublime, simple,
grave and holy? In such instances the only remedy is an imperative: "Organum non pulsetur“ — the organ
shall not be played. If, however, an accompaniment is desirable, well, let it be one correctly contrived, tona-
lity in consonance with the nature of the melody, sustaining the voice of the priest "and doing full justice to
text and melody.

In this sense the harmonizations must be taken. Respecting the execution of the organ part we will
merely state, 1) that only soft stops (8’) are to be drawn, by means of which the priest will keep the proper
pitch, his voice will be sustained and not drowned. The organ is but to serve and not to domineer, the former
to be done in the most discreet manner. — 2) The accompaniment is to be executed ﬂuently in order not to
impede the declamation of the text. Hence the Organist always ought to be guided by the chant at the altar.
If the priest evinces any inclination to ﬂatten his voice, a little more powerful stop will restore his proper
pitch instantly. The question as to what chord should be the closing one· of the preface is easily answered.
In as much as the following ”Sanctus“ is intimately connected with the Preface, the chord to be played will
be either majOr or minor, according the the incipient chord of the Sanctus. — The responses should be taken

from the Roman missal and sung in unison by choir and congregation. The Antiphones, by which the
w*

180 Ι Appendix.

priest greets and invites the choir, — the representative of the congregation —- to offer up praise and thanks-
giving, would be more worthily re-echoed. Thus after the grandest of hymns of praise, the choir will chime
in with the angels singing before the throne of the Lamb, the thrice Holy, Holy, Holy, for the glory of the
Lord and His immaculate Spouse, the church, as well as for the ediﬁcation and salvation of the faithful.
