 Neque in bicipiti somniisse Paruasso
 Memini, ut repente sic poeta prodirem.

 Hederaa sequaces : ipse semipaganua
 Ad sacra vatum carmen affero nostrum.

 Cantare credas Pegaseium nectar.

 THE SATIRES 0F JUVENAL

 Dacmus Jumus Juvnnar. was born at Α uinum, a town of the
 Volsci, about the thirty-eighth (or, more pr ably, the forty-sec—
 ond) year of the Christian era. It is uncertain whether he was

 »the so; or the foster-son of a rich freedrqan, who gave him a. lib-
 eral e ucation. -

 _ From the time of his birth, until he had attained about the age
 of forty, nothing more is known of him than that his attention was
 devoted to the study of eloquence, and to declamation, more in-
 deed fer his own amusement and improvement, than from any in-
 tontion todevote himself to a public life.

 ‘ _ About this time he applied himself to the study of poetry, and
 commenced satirizing the predominant vices of the day.

 ’ Against Paris, a pantomime dancer, and favorite of the Empe-
 ror ‘oxnitian, Juvenal seems to have directed the ﬁrst shafts of
 satire : in consequence of this attack, he was banished into Egypt,
 having been ordered to repair thither, as commander of a compa-
 ny of «ἔτεμε, where, soon alter, he died, in about the eightieth
 year 0 a age.

 SATIRE I.

 - In the beginning of this Satire, the poet gives a humorous ac-
 count of the reasons which induced him to commence writing:—
 that, his patience having been entirely exhausted by the rehearsals
 of wretched poets, he could refrain no longer,but intended to repay
 them in kind. He aﬁerwards informs us wh he devotes himself
 to Satire in preference to any other kind 0 poetry, to which he
 declares he is driven by_ the Vices of the age, of which he gives a

 the danger of satirizing living villany, and professes to treat of

 used emphatically. It was customary among the ancients to re-
 cite their works privately, among their particular friends; or pub-
 licly, either in the temple of Apollo, or in the spacious houses of
 some rich and great man.—Reponam: a metaphor taken from the
 repayment of money. ·

 2. Band . . . Codri: ‘with the Theseis of hoarse Codrus.’—
 ' Theseide .· i. e. recitatione Theseidis; a. poem or tragedy which
 described the actions of Theseus, the author οξ which was Codrus,
 a poor and mean poet, who is here supposedto have made himself
 hoarse by frequently reading his poem. ‚ “ ’

 3. Togata: : ‘comedies ;’ there were three different kinds of
 comegy, en‘ch denominated from the dress of the persons repre-
 sente :—

 Togata, so called from the toga, a gown worn by the ’common
 people, which exhibited the actions of the lower ort :—-—Pr¢ete.rta-
 ta, so called from the praeteria, a white robe, ornamented with
 purple, and worn by ma 'strates and nobles, which described the
 actions of this Class:~ alliata, from the pallium, an upper gar-
 ment, worn by the Greeks, and in which the actors were habited,
 when the manners and actions of the Greeks were represented.

 4. Elegos .· these were short poems on mournful subjects gen-
 erally, written in hexameter and pentameter verses alternately.

 5.4 Tcl hus: some tedious play on the subject of Telephus, son
 of Herculgs and Ange, and king of Mysia, who was wounded by
 the spear of Achilles, but aﬁerwards healed by its rust-Aut . . .
 Creates: ‘or shall the traged of Orestes, the margin of the whole
 book being already full, an written on the back too, but not yet
 ﬁnished, waste the whole day ?’

 7. Inuus Martis .· ‘ the grove of Mars ;’ that is, as some under-
 stand it, the history of Romulus and Remus, whom Rhea Silvia
 bore in a grove sacred to Mars, near Albaz—this and the other
 subjects mentioned were so continually dinned into his ears, that
 the places were as familiar as his own house.

 8. Eoliis . . . rupibus to the north of Sicily are seven rocky
 islands, which were called the Eolian or Vulcanian (now the Li-
 pari) islands. To Hiera, one of these, Snow Vulcano,) J uvenal
 probably refers; and by antrum Vultum et Cyclopum, Etna is
 meant. -

 learning, who was in the habit of lending his porticoes to the po-

 with statues.—Convulsaque . . . clamant .· ‘the convulsed marble

 lamations on various subjects were introduced; 'one of these dis-
 cussions, while J'uvenal was at school, was “ whether Sylla. should
 take the dictatorship, or live in ease‘ and quiet as a private man P”
 He had maintained the latter proposition.

 ers, if I do not use it. v ’

 racing, and applied here to the writing of Satire.

 . Aurunca.- Aurunca, an ancient city of Latium, in Italy,
 was the birthplace of the great Roman satir st, Lucilius.

 21. Admittitis-.- admitto literally signiﬁes to ‘admit,’ but it is
 sometimes used with auribus understood, and then it signiﬁes ‘to
 hearken, to attend.’ - _ j

 εκὲἕῗεὶξὶίῦεί . . . aurum .· the Romans arrived at such a height
 of luxury, that they wore large and heavy rings m Winter, but
 lighter ones in summer. The effeminate Egyptian is here repre-
 ' sented as ‘ waving to and fro ’ (ventilo) his hand in the air, to cool
 his ﬁngers (or, more probably,to display his ring), on one of which
 he wore a summer ring. -

 thereby had amassed a’ great fortune. -

 33. Plena ipso .· this alludes either to his corpulency, or to the
 haughty manner, which he assumed while in the sedan—Balaton .·
 critics are divided about the man, who followed Matho.‘ The old
 Scholiast says it was Heliodorus, the Stoic, who informed against
 L. Junius Silanus, Massa, and Carus; others, that it was E
 tim Celer, g Stoic- philosopher, who, by false testimony, ruine his
 friend and pupil, Bareas Soranus: but more probably it was M.
 Regulus, mentioned by Pliny, who carried on the trade of inform-
 er under Nero and Domitian. Or, perhaps, the poet did not al-
 lude to one informer, but to several.——Magné amicis this means
 either that the informer was in the employ of some dietinguishcd
 friend, for instance the Emperor; or that he had laid information

 some information which Latinus dreaded.

 38. Quum . . . prostantis .· he now satirizes such guardians as

 41. Ab octava .- the eighth—hour of the natural day, or two

 pro-consul of Africa, and being prosecuted by the province for
 ‘ cruelty and extortion, was convicted, ﬁned, and banished from
 Italy. Yet retaining the greater part of his former spoils, he
 lived in _a. wanton exile; while the Africans returned home with
 the wretched consolation of having defrayed their own expenses,
 and seenthe money, levied on their oppressor, carried to the Ro-

 sumptuous entertainments, provided for themselves alone.

 87. Sportula .- this was ‘a little basket’or pannier, made of a

 »kind of broom, called spartum. According to Suetonius, Nero
 forbade clients to be introduced to the entertainments'of the rich,
 as had been the custom amon the ancients, but ordered, that a
 dole of victuals or money mig t be distributed to them, in little

 89. Ille : Ruperti understands this as applying. to the ‘ sordid

 man who distributed the dole.—-—Et trepidat .· lest the dole should
 be given to an impostor.

 91. Agnitus .· ‘recognised as one of his clients.’ ι

 92. Ipsae Trojugenas : ‘the very descendants of Enéas.’ The
 poet now inveighs against many of the Roman nobility, who
 were so mennas to scramble among the poor for these donations.
 The word ipsos makes the sarcasm the stronger.

 tere, the storks’ nest being visited.’ he temple of Concord was
 erected by Tibeaius, at the request of his mother Livia. About
 this temple, storks and other birds were in the habit of building
 their nests. What the poet says, alludes to the chattering noise
 made by these birds, when the old ones revisited their nests, after
 having been out in quest of food for their oung. Commentators
 remark that Concord was worshipped un er the form of a stark,
 being very easily tamed, and that the ﬂight of these birds was
 considered a~peaceful omen. Some understand the bustle of the
 senate hurrying into this temple, where they held their meetings.
 Others think, the poet satirically intimates, that this building was
 already in ruins, and inhabited only by birds.

 SATIRE II.

 This Satire contains an animated and severe attack upon the
 hypocrisy of philosophers and priests, and the eﬁ'eminacy of inil-
 it‘ary oﬂic’ers and magistrates ; it exposes their ignorance, proﬂi-
 gacy, and impiety, With just severity.

 ly victorions, whose wounds are scarcely healed, and the rough

 do not assume this hue all'at once, but one after the other; which
 the vulgar suppose was owing to the grapes looking upon each
 other, and thus contracting the same color.

 A proverbial expression of a similar kind is found in many lan-

 uages. “One plum gets color by looking at another,” is'said to
 ξε a common phrase in Persia, to signify the propagation of an

 66. Accipient te .· the poet now exposes a set of unnatural ⁷
 wretches, who, in imitation of women, celebrated the mysteries
 of the Bona Dea or Good Goddess, who was a Roman lady, the
 wife of one Faunus, and famous for her chastity ; after her death
 she was consecrated. Sacriﬁces wereperformed to her only by
 night and secretly; to her was sacriﬁced a saw pig. At these
 rites none but women were admitted.

 At the new institution, of which the poet is now speaking, no
 females were admitted.

 the priests bathed themselves in the most effeminate manner.— ~

 › 76. Ille . . . ecu: it was customary at Rome for the ladies to

 _ wet with this composition, and drawn obliquely over or ajo

 is used, as descriptive of the shield of Abas. Eneid III, 268.

 - Ere cavo cl um, magni gestamen Abantia,
 Postibue ercisfgo, 811:.

 And in En. VII, 246, Virgil, speaking of the ornaments
 which Priam wore, when he sat in public among his subjects, as
 their prince and lawgivcr, says :—

 SATIRE In.

 Umbricius, an Aruspex, and a friend of J-uvenal, disgusted at

 . the prevalence’of vice, and total disregard of unassumin virtue,

 _ , is introduced on the point of quitting Rome for Cumae. he poet
 accompanies him some little way from the city, when the honest
 exile, no longer able to suppress his indignation, acquaints him
 with the causes of his retirement.

 — “’hut he says may be arranged under the following heads,—
 that Flattery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome ; that
 in these, particularly the ﬁrst, foreigners have a manifest superi-

 general habits of extravagance render it diﬁcult for thein to sub-
 s'ist; and that a crowded capital subjects them to numberless in-
 conveniences unknown in the country: he then again adverts to
 the peculiar suiferings of the poorer citizens from the want of a
 well regulated police; these he illustrates by a'variety of exam-
 ples, and concludes in a strain of pathos and beauty, which winds
 up the whole with singular effect.

 that from her mouth he received his whole form of government.
 In the grove where they met was a temple sacred to the Muses
 and to this goddess, whose fountain watered the grove ; for it is

 writers, to believe that the picture is as faithful as it is animated;
 it is nearly that, in short, of every overgrown and vicious capital,
 which is not protected by a vigilant police.

 SATIRE IV.-

 J uvenal, in this Satire, indulges his honest indignaﬁon against
 Crispinus and his employer Domitian.

 After describin some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the
 poet makes a and en'transitiou to his extravagance and gluttony,
 and thereby takes occasion to describe a ridiculous consultation,
 held by Domitian over a turbot, which was too large to be con-
 tained in any dish, that could be found. After a long delibera-
 vion-among the senators,‘it was proposed, that the_ﬁsh should be
 ﬁä‘i‘aﬁä‘iﬁﬁäﬁi‘i’ä’äeimäfäi fiéuiilﬁtati‘eié’é’inﬁi‘oi’é ξ’ἓέἳῐέῑ
 a dish, large enough to contain it, should he made expressly for
 the purpose of receivi ’ it. ·

 The council is then ismissed, and the Satire concludes with a
 most severe censure .on the emperor’s cruelty and injustice to-
 wards some of the best and most worth of the Romans. -

 literature labored at Rome. · ·

 Beginning with Poetry, it proceeds with great regularity
 through the various departments of History, Law, Oratory, Rhet-

 and each different head e ivened with such satirical, humorous,
 _ and sentimental remarks, as' naturally ﬂow from the subject.

 The subjector this Satire is the Vanity of Human Wishes.
 The poet takes his stand on the great theatre ’of the world and
 summons before him the illustrious characters of all ages. As
 they appear in succession, he shows, from the principal events
 of their lives. how little piness is promoted, by the attainment
 of what our indistinct and unded views represent, as the most
 perfect of earthly blessings. Of these be instances wealth,

 to their respective possessors. ’ rom hence, he argues the wis-
 dom of ocquiescing in the dispensatione of Heaven; and con-
 cludes with a form of prayer, in which he points” out, with great
 force and beauty,the ob cts for which a rational being may pre-
 sume to approach the A mighty.

 Juvenal seems, in"the composition of this Satire, to have had
 in his thoughts Plato’s second dialogue of Alcibiades and Per-
 sius’s second Satire ; he has, however, taken nothing from them,
 but the general idea; the'ﬁllin up is entirel his own.

 7 SATIRE am.

 The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end‘of
 self-improvement. B showing the facility with which children
 copy the vices of their parents, he ints out the necessity, as
 well as the sacred duty, of giving em examples of domestic
 purit and virtue.

 A r brieﬂy enumerating the several vices, glutton , cruelty,
 debauchery, die. which youth imperceptibly imbibe their
 seniors; he enters more fully upon that of avarice, of which he
 shows the fatal and inevitable consequences. ‘

 SATIRE XVI.

 This Satire is sup used to have been written by Juvenal, while
 he commanded in Egypt: he. sets forth, ironically, the advan-
 tages and privileges of the soldiery, and how happy they are be-
 yond others, whom he mentions, while, in reality, he is satirizing
 their extreme licentiousness and insolence. .
 Many have thought that this Satire was not written by Ju-

 Aunus Pusrus chcus was born at Volaterra; a town of
 Etruria, A. D. 34. His father was of Equestrian nuk, and died
 when his son was about six years of age. Persius studied at
 Volaterras, until he had attained his twelfth year: after that he
 was removed to Rome, and laced under the care of Palemon, s.
 grammar-inn, and Verginius laccus, a rhetoricum. Atthe age of
 sixteen, he was placed under the tuition of Annuus Cornutus, a
 Stole philosopher, to whom the nm» Satire is addressed, and in
 whose praise it is written. During the reign of Nero, Pes-siun
 distinguished himself for his satiric com itions, in which he did '
 not even spare the emperor himself. e died at his estate, near
 Rome, in the twen eighth year of his age, in the consulship of
 Rubrius Marius an Asmius Gallus. “

 has two barks—the outer, which is much thicker than the inner
 one, should be removed at certain seasons of the year. If this
 is not done, the outer bark bursts and· makes the surface of the
 tree very rough: Persius therefore says, Virgil is like an old
 branch of a large cork-tree, the outer bark of which has not been
 removed at the proper season, but has become withered up with
 age and dried up by the heat of the sun, which is the meamn of
 eoduma-Another way in which _it is understood is this ς-ᾗοτ·
