 1PUBLISHED ΒΥ THE AUTHORITY OF HER MAJESTY! TREASURY, UNDER THE
 Δ DIRECTION OF THE MASTER OF THE ROLLS.

  

  

 ON the 26th of January 1857, the Master of the Rolls
 submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
 of materials for the History of this Country from the
 Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

 The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
 should be selected for publication under competent editors
 without reference to periodical or chronological arrange- t
 ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
 given, in the ﬁrst instance, to such materials as were most
 scarce and valuable.

 He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
 to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the
 editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps; and for this
 purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
 accurate collation of the best MSS.

 To render the work more generally useful, the Master
 of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
 account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
 their peculiarities; that he should add to the work a brief
 account of the life and times of the author, and any
 remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but no other
 note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be
 necessary to establish the correctness of the text.

 The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
 they were ﬁnished; the whole responsibility of the task
 resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
 Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

 The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a careful
 consideration. of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
 Treasury Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
 recommended by the Master of the Rolls. “ was well
 calculated for the accomplishment of this important
 national object, in an eﬁ'ectual and satisfactory manner,
 within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
 paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements,

 . without unnecessary expense.”

 They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
 each chronicle and historical document should be edited
 in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct-
 ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation ’of the
 best MSS., and that no notes should be added, except
 such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
 suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
 contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
 Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
 so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose, and
 an estimate of his historical credibility and value.

 INTRODUCTION.

  

 Tm: present Volume completes the publication of Liber
 Albus and Liber Custwnawxm ,· with the addition, by
 way of Appendix, of some extracts from the Aesica,
 Pam's and the Liber Memmndomm, two mediaeval
 compilations, of minor size and value, in the possession
 of the Corporation of the City of London.

 ,In reference to its Contents :—

 The Translation of the Anglo-Norman passages in
 Liber Albus, as in the case of similar passages in Liber
 Ouetumaown, has been made as literally throughout
 as, consistently with the requirements of· good grammar,
 it could be. The Glossaries also have been compiled
 on the same ‘principle as those which accompany that
 Volume ; the Anglo-Norman Glossary consisting of such
 words, or forms of words, as are not to be found in
 Roquefort’s Glossa/i/re de la Langue Romane (a work
 which, unfortunately, from the comparative paucity of
 the books consulted by its Compiler, is anything but
 calculated for the elucidation of the Anglo-Norman
 dialect) 5- and the Glossary of Mediaaval Latin containing
 such words as not only are not to be met with in
 ordinary Dictionaries, but in many instances are to be
 sought in vain in the elaborate pages of Du Gange. -

 The Appendices consist of Extracts from the Aesica
 Pamie, the Liber Memoramdmmm, and Letter-Book K,
 all preserved in the Record-Room at Guildhall.

 The Assists Pam/is is a folio volume, containing 164
 leaves of parchment, the last thirty-four of which are

 blank; and consists of entries more or less intimately
 connected with the Assay and Assize of Bread by the
 civic authorities between the twenty-ﬁrst year of Ed-
 ward I. and the sixteenth of Henry VI. The greater
 portion of its contents, as might be anticipated from a
 reference to pages 349-353 of Liber Albus, is of a
 purely formal character, consisting, for the most part, of
 columns of ﬁgures, in reference to the weight and price
 of bread. As, however, upon examinetion,it has been
 found to contain several curious particulare, nowhere else
 to be met with, in reference to the varieties of bread,
 the bakers, the frauds of the trade, and consequent
 punishments, during the fourteenth and ﬁfteenth cen-
 turies, the Editor has thought it desirable to extract
 from it all matter of this description, as a not unsuit-
 able Appendix to the more formal details given on
 these subjects in pages 349-358 of Liber Albus. With
 this object, each page of the Aesica. Panis has been
 carefully subjected to several examinations; and the
 reader, who can hardly fail to ﬁnd much in these
 extracts to interest him alike by their quaintness and
 their novelty, may rest assured that there is not a
 passage of any value in the Assisa Panis, with which
 he is left unacquainted. On referring to page 602
 (Book IV.) of Liber Albus, it would seem either that
 the reference to the account of the fraud committed by
 certain London bakers by surreptitiously making holes
 in their ‘ moulding-boards,’ had been lost or mislaid by
 Carpenter or his amanuenses, or that the narrative itself
 of this singular transaction was then considered to be
 no longer in existence. In pages 416—420 of the pre-
 sent Volume, the Editor has had the satisfaction of
 exhuming it from the pages of the Assiea Pamie.

 The Liber Menwrmdorum is a small quarto volume
 of the time of Edward II., and perhaps, to some ex—
 tent, of the early part of the reign of Edward 111.,
 containing 193 leaves of parchment, those after folio 170
 being in general left blank. Such passages-1n this

  

  

  

  

 INTRODUCTION. xi

 Volume as seemed either to be of value in an historical
 point of View, or likely to interest the antiquarian
 reader, have been extracted by the Editor, and are
 printed in Appendix IL, pp. 430-456 of the present
 Volume. Among them, attention may be called more
 particularly to the Charter granted by Queen Alianor to
 the Brethren in London of the Penance of Jesus Christ
 (p. 430); the Regulations for the due making of mea-
 sures by the Turners of London (p. 432); the extor-
 tions practised by Edward II. upon the City of London
 in the exaction of loans, and the breach of good faith
 committed by him, at least upon one occasion (pp. 433-
 437); the Writ of Edward II. (omitted in the new
 edition of Rymer’s Eosdem) enjoining, that the Statute
 of Winchester shall be duly observed within the City
 of London (pp. 437-439); the Proclamation, temp. Ed-
 ward II.‚ against the playing at foot-ball within the
 City (p. 440); the Ordinances of the London Cord-
 wainers, temp. Henry III. (pp. Mal—44:5); and the Grant
 of a Corody by the Wardens of London Bridge (pp. 449-
 453); the latter aﬁ'ording, incidentally, some account of
 the construction of the Bridge House, in the thirteenth
 century, which formerly stood over the Chapel of St.
 Thomas in the centre of Old London Bridge, and
 giving an interesting insight into the usages and re-
 quirements of English domestic life in the time of
 Edward I.

 The Mediseval Glossary of Anglo-Saxon terms (printed
 in pp. 453-456, from the same Volume,) is also of
 interest, and will repay comparison with a somewhat
 similar extract given in Appendix G. to Mr. Luard’s
 Fmgbieh History of Bartholomew Cotton, printed in the
 present Series. It purports to have been compiled by
 “ Alexander, Archiepiscopus Salapiaa,” but as it is
 evident that there is some mistake as to the title, we
 may safely conclude that Alexander, Archdeacon of
 Shrewsbury, (who wrote a Preface to the Red Book
 of the Ewchequer) is the person meant

 xii mmonucmou.

 In pages 431, 433, 445, and 449, references are given
 to passages in Liber Omtmnamn and Liber Albee,
 upon which some additional light may possibly be
 thrown by matter found in this Appendix.

 The Letter of John Carpenter (pp. 457—464) de-
 scriptive of the entry of King Henry VI. into the City
 of LOndon on the 20th of February 1432, extracted
 from Letter-Book K, preserved et Guildhall, has been
 printed by M. Delpit, in pp. 244—248 of his Oolleebion
 anlmledeeDomwntoFramme-smutin soincorrect a
 form as to render it worse than valueless. M. Delpit
 has failed too to detect the ﬁct that under the sub-
 scription, “ Per Fabrum, sive Domiﬁcem, vestrum,
 “ J ohannem,” John ‘Carpenter, Secretary, or Common
 Clerk, to the City of London, is undoubtedly meant.
 The ﬁrst address, in English, mode by the Mayor of
 London to the Sovereign (p. 458), will be found, on
 comparison, to diﬁ'er very materially from the version

 CHAPTER XVI.
 [The Election of Sherife] Page 43.

 _ As concerning the election of Sheriffs,—the Mayor, F-lz-n-
 Recorder, Aldermen, and Commons, are to be assembled
 on the day of Saint Matthew the Apostle [21 Septem-
 ber], in such manner as is ordained on the election of
 the Mayor; and in the ﬁrst place, the Mayor shall
 choose, of his own free will, a reputable man, free of the
 City, to be one of the Sheriﬂ's for the ensuing year;
 for whom he is willing to answer as to one halfof the
 ferm of the City due unto the King, if he who is so elected
 by the Mayor shall prove not suﬁicient. But if the
 Mayor elect him by counsel and with the assent of
 the Aldermen, they ought to be answerable with him.
 And those who are elected for the Common Council,
 themselves, and the others summoned by the Mayor for
 this purpose, as before declared, shall choose another
 Sheriff, for the commonalty; for whom all the com-
 monalty is bound to be answerable as to the other half
 of the ferm so due to the King, in case he shall prove not
 sufﬁcient. And if any controversy arise between the
 commons as to the election, let it be done and dis-
 cussed in such manner as is contained in the article

 A 2

 4 LIBEB mus. [n I.

 upon the ‘Common Council ’ in the Thirteenth Chapter
 of this First Book.

 And if any one of those then chosen to be Sheriﬁ‘s shall
 refuse or absent himself, so as not to be ready at the
 Guildhall on the Vigil of Saint Michael next ensuing, at
 ten by the clock, [there] to receive his charge, there shall
 be levied forthwith from the goods, lands, and tenements,
 of him who so absents himself, one hundred pounds;
 one half to the use of the Chamber, and the other half to
 the use of him who shall then he suddenly elected and
 charged by reason of his default. And if the second
 person elected shall refuse the charge, all his goods,
 lands, and tenements shall be arrested, for all expenses
 touching that ofﬁce.

 And the old Sheriffs shall come to the Guildhall, at
 eleven by the clock at the very latest, and shall deliver
 unto the Mayor (at the latest, at the Mayor’s General
 Court that is held aﬁer the Feast of the Epiphany) all
 records of pleas touching freeholds pleaded before
 them in their time, with all other memoranda touching
 recoveries suﬂ'ered by any person, under a penalty of
 one hundred shillings, to be levied from each of them
 and to be paid to the use of the Chamber. To do
 which, the Mayor shall warn them the day on which
 they shall receive their charge. And then the Mayor
 shall deliver the Cocket to such Sheriﬂ‘ as he himself
 shall have chosen, and the records to the Chamber-
 lain, for safe custody ; and forthwith, the newly elected
 are to be charged in such form as is written in the
 Second Part of Book III. of this Volume, folio 25.

 [The Oath of all the maye Servo/ate, and their
 duties] Page 45.

 And as soon as the Sheriﬂ's are sworn, all the servants
 of their ofﬁce—clerks, seljeants and their vadlets, bailiﬁ's
 of the customs and of Middlesex, the gaoler of Neugate

 and his clerk—shall also be sworn, each according to
 that which pertains unto the position that he holds, any
 oath made before to their masters to the contrary not-
 withstanding. And he who refuses such oaths is to be
 adjudged incapable of holding any ofﬁce for that year.
 And he who does not appear that day to receive the
 charge before the said Mayor and Aldermen, shall lose
 all his ofﬁces for that year. And none of the Sheriffs
 shall have more than eight serjeants, but fewer, if they
 may sufﬁce to execute the business of the public. The
 oaths of the Under-Sheriff and of all the Sheriffs’ clerks,
 of the serjeants of the Sheriffs, and of the vadlets of the
 serjeants, are set forth in the Second Part of Book III.
 of this Volume, folio 27.

 Item, after dinner on the same day, the old and the
 new Sheriffs shall go together to the prison of Neugate ;
 and there the new Sheriﬁ‘s shall receive all the prisoners
 by indenture made between them and the old Sheriffs,
 and shall place safeguard there at their own peril,
 without letting the gaol to ferm. And be it made
 known, that all proﬁts arising from any customs or
 bailiwicks pertaining unto the Sheriﬁ's of London and
 Middlesex, alter the hour of noon on the Vigil of Saint
 Michael aforesaid, shall belong to the new Sheriffs, and
 before the hour of noon to the old ones.

 Item, no Sheriff hereaﬁer shall take any ﬁne from
 baker or from brewster, beyond what it is ordained for
 them to take. And if any Sheriff shall do so, and be
 attainted thereof, he shall pay for each penny so received
 twalve pence unto the Chamber.

 Item, if it happen, which may God forbid, that any
 one of the Sheriﬁ‘s or their ofﬁcers shall have especial
 command on part of the Mayor or Aldermen to per-
 form any business touching the City, and such Sheriff
 or his ofﬁcers will not take in hand the same, such
 Sheriff or oﬂicer shall be warned forthwith to appear
 before the Mayor and Aldermen, and the Common

 nun.

 Council of the City, there to answer why he has not
 done what he was commanded to do. And if he shall
 not think proper to appear on the day appointed, or
 if he shall come and not oﬂ'er reasonable excuse, let
 him be ousted from his ofﬁce and another established
 in his place. And if such default shall be found in a
 servant of the Sheriffs, let him be ousted ﬁ'om his oﬂice
 and adjudged incapable of holding any other oﬂice in
 the said city, thenceforth for ever, without restitution
 thereof. And also, neither Mayor, Sheriﬂ', nor Alder-
 men, clerks of the Sheriﬂ's or of the Chamber, seijeants,
 bedels, serjeants’ vadlets, porters of the Compters,
 nor officers of Newgate, nor their vadlets, shall from
 henceforth, either themselves or by others, brew for
 sale, keep oven, or let carts for hire; nor shall they
 be‘regrators of any provisions, or hucksters of ale, or
 in partnership with such. And let the person who will
 not make oath thereto, or who shall contravene this
 ordinance, be ousted from his oﬂice for ever.

 Item, the Sheriffs shall not let the County of M iddlesex
 to ferm in any manner, but the same shall remain in
 their own keeping, by their deputy; that so the folks
 in the said County of Middlesex may be treated and
 governed in due manner as the law demands, without
 extortion committed upon any one.

 Item, the said Sheriffs shall not let the Gaol of
 Neugate to ferm, but shall put there a man, sufﬁcient
 and of good repute, to keep the said gaol in due manner,
 without taking anything of him for such keeping thereof,
 by covenant made in private or openly. And the
 gaoler, who by the said Sheriﬁ‘s shall be deputed there-
 unto, shall make oath before the Mayor and Alder-
 men, that neither he, nor any other for him, shall take
 ﬁne or extortionate charge from any prisoner for putting
 on or taking oﬂ' his irons, or shall receive monies
 extorted from any prisoner. But it shall be fully lawful
 for the said gaoler to take from each person, when set

 at liberty, four pence for his fee, as from ancient
 times has been the usage: but he shall take from no
 person at his entrance there, nor shall he issue [exe-
 cation] suddenly, by 1command of the Mayor and
 Aldermen, without other process. And if he shall be
 found to commit extortion upon any one, let him be
 ousted from his ofﬁce, and be punished at the dis-
 cretion of the Mayor and Aldermen, and Common
 Council of the City. ”

 Item, the seijeants’ grooms who “seize cartagc, shall
 take no more carts or horses than are necessary, and
 even then, such carts and horses [only] as are on
 hire; and not those of poor folks who bring victuale
 and other merchandize to the City, while they spare
 carts and horses that are to be let on hire, for their
 own private advantage,——on pain of being dismissed
 from their ofﬁce for ever.

 CHAPTER XVIII.

 [The Fees and Duties of the Chamberlain, his clerk,

 and his derha] Page 47.

 The Chamberlain, the Common Seljeant-at-Law, who
 is otherwise called the ‘Common aCountor,’ and the
 Common Clerk, shall be elected by the Common
 Council of the City, and removed, at their pleasure.
 And each of these shall receive for his labour from
 the Chamber ten pounds petr annum. And further,
 the Common Clerk shall receive sustenance for his
 clerks in either Chamber, and for each deed and will
 enrolled in the Hustings, ten pence; and for every
 deed enrolled in the Mayor’s Rolls, he shall take two

 shillings; and for every writ of assize, of nuisance,
 and of intrusion, and for every precept directed unto
 the Sheriﬂ's for pleas of Hastings, and for every writ
 of Scire facias and of Fieri facias six pence, the case
 of Aldermen excepted.

 And the Chamberlain shall give in his account
 each year, between the Feasts of Saint Michael and of
 Saint Simon and Saint Jude the Apostles [28 October],
 at the latest, before two Aldermen and four of the
 Commons, who shall be chosen by the Common Council
 of the City, on the Day of Saint Matthew [21 Sep—
 tember], to take such account. And the persons so
 chosen shall appoint for the Chamberlain a certain day,
 upon which he shall hold himself in readiness to
 render his account. And also, the Wardens of the
 Bridge shall each year give in their account in the
 same manner, before the same auditors, or others by
 the Common Council thereunto assigned.

 Item, if any one shall ask to see any record, he
 shall shew unto the Chamberlain or unto the Common
 Clerk the reason for his demand; and if it shall
 seem reasonable unto the Chamberlain or the Common
 Clerk, it shall be shewn unto him by a clerk, sworn
 unto the Chamber, and not otherwise; and if he shall
 wish to have a copy, he shall have the same for a
 competent payment, to be given to him who shall
 makethe trans cri t. And if any clerk shall other-
 wise disclose the secrets of the rules and records, and
 shall be clearly convicted thereof, he shall be punished
 bodily by imprisonment, and shall lose his ofﬁce for
 ever.

 Item, the clerk of the Chamberlain shall receive
 in part for his labour one half of the sum that arises
 from the twelve pence taken for the entry of writs of
 franchise; and further, he shall receive for his labour
 what the auditors of the Chamberlain’s account may
 think proper to allow him, at their discretion.

 Item, he who is Mayor for the time being, and is
 sworn unto the City, and [is also] Escheator for such
 time being, shall keep a clerk for that ofﬁce; for
 whom he shall be prepared to answer as well unto
 the King as to the City, for the saving of his own
 honour and estate.

 Item, the Common Serjeant-at-Arms of the City,
 who is otherwise called the ‘ Common Crier,’ shall be
 always of the household of the Mayor for the time
 being, and ready at his commands, as the other
 serjeants are; and he shall receive from the Chamber
 sixty shillings each year, and a further sum, if such
 shall seem reasonable to the auditors of the Chamber-
 lain’s account, in consideration of his good behaviour;
 and he shall receive from each of the Aldermen, for
 his fee, the entire robes or cloaks in which they are
 sworn upon the day on which they receive charge of
 their oﬂice, or else six shillings and eight pence, at
 their own pleasure; and he shall further receive from
 the Sheriﬂ's twelve pence for every cry that he makes
 throughout the City; [to enable him] to do which, they
 shall ﬁnd him a sufﬁcient horse, for the honour of the
 City. And he shall also receive for each testament
 proclaimed at the Hustings, and for each plea de-
 termined at the Hustings, four pence, as his fee.
 And such serjeant shall be elected by the Common
 Council, and removed when they please.

 Item, the Mayor shall have two other serjeants at
 least, and an esquire, a man well bred (one who
 knows how in all places, in that which unto such
 service pertains, to support the honour of his lord and
 of the City), to hear his sword before him, at the
 private cost of such Mayor. Saving however, that
 each of, these three shall receive from the Chamber
 forty shillings per ammam, and no more, as his

 Adam Roem made plaint against John Buquente,
 for felony and for robbery, and offered to prove the
 same, as being one of the franchise of London. John
 denied all, and put 1himself out of the franchise, and
 made oﬁ'er to defend himself by his body. Adam said
 that he would not for him lose his franchise; for that

 no man of the franchise ought to do battle if he ‹

 does not wish. It was then adjudged that John must
 make his law, himself the ’eighteenth; for that since
 both were of the same franchise, no wager of battle
 lay, if they did not both wish it, even though [in

 dead, it was awarded that William should remain upon

 Pleas of the Crown; that is to say, if in the mean-
 while any one should prosecute the said charge; in
 which case, if any one should so prosecute it, right
 should be done therein. And if no one should prose—

 King should think proper to prosecute; in which
 case he was [to clear himself by six compurgators],
 himself the seventh ; and if he should be cast therein,
 he was to be in the same plight as he would have
 been in as towards the [original] accuser; in such
 manner as has been ‘before written thereupon.

 And these six-and-thirty men ought to be chosen the
 same day by the reputable men of the City, if the
 Justiciar shall so will it, or at such other time as the
 Justiciar shall think proper; that is to say, eighteen
 men from the East side of Walebroke, and eighteen
 men from the West side of Walebroke. And when

 they shall be thus chosen by the men of the City—-
 and not by a Sheriﬁ‘ or by the Chamberlain—their
 names must be taken down in writing, and delivered
 to the person who is to have them. And if he shall
 challenge any one of them, either for love towards the
 other, or for hatred, or for kindred, or for any other
 thing, such person ought to be removed, and another
 substituted by the reputable men; and a day must
 be assigned him, to have them ready at the end of
 the quinzaine, or at a further time, at the pleasure of
 the Justiciars. And if it shall so happen, that he
 cannot have them ready at the day given him, on
 the third day before such day he must shew the same
 unto the Sheriﬂ‘; and upon the day he must shew
 the same before the Justiciars, and the Sheriﬁ‘ must
 bear witness thereto. And then, upon such proof, and
 upon the testimony of the Sheriff, they must award
 him a ¹ [future day], etc.

 Mnooneehall be putupon trial by theratLaw

 It should also be known, that no man ought to be
 put upon trial by the Great Law, except for the greatest
 cause that can be; such as, for the death of a man,
 and that with pursuit, and with cry raised, and with
 witness thereto; or for hamsoken apparent, and for
 doors broken and hewn down, and pursuit thereon;
 and for wounds open and apparent, and the like mat-
 ters. For there is no law in London that puts a man
 to death or in peril of limb, except this law. And
 therefore it is necessary that there should be some great
 reason to call for trial by this law. For as to the other
 laws waged in Pleas of the Crown, such as that by
 eighteen men, if the persons are cast, they are only

 amerced in property, and the amount of their lWere,
 that is to say, one hundred shillings. And in this
 [latter] case, the accused makes oath three times, which
 the English call ⁹ ‘trefalde.’ In this he has to make
 oath three times, each time himself the 5’sixth; and this,
 for the dignity of the Court and for the honour
 of justice.

 But on trial by the Great Law, the inculpated makes
 oath but once, and that, the ﬁrst of all, by reason of
 the great peril there is in ﬁnding the compurgators.
 For if a single person should fail him or retract, then
 [the accused] is a. dead man, and just the same as though
 he had been conquered in the 4ﬁeld. And by reason of
 this great peril he makes oath but 5once, in trial by
 the Great Law, and then the others after him. And
 some say that if the inculpated is a. husband and a
 landholder, it is necessary that his jurors also should be
 husbands, and should hold lands in the City. But the
 inculpated may rightfully have with him bachelors or
 widowers, provided they be lawful men ; and the like
 as to the converse.

 If the King sues against any man a Plea of the

 to be awarded unto him that he defend himself [by six

 so, if he had been cast to peril of life or limb, it would
 be the like in this case.

 CHAPTER LXIII.

 Of holding the Folkmotes. Page 118.

 There are three principal Folkmotes in the year. One
 is at the Feast of Saint Michael, to know who shall be
 Sheriff, andtohear the charge. The secondisat Christmas,
 to arrange the ‘Wards. The third is at the Feast of
 Saint John [24 June], to protect the City from ﬁre, by
 reason of the great drought. If any man of London
 neglects to attend at one of these three Folkmotes, he
 is to forfeit forty shillings to the King. But by the
 law of London, the Sheriff ought to enquire alter him
 whom he shall think proper, that is to say, whether
 he is there or not. And if there be any one who is
 not there, and he is there enquired after, such person
 ought to be summoned to the Hustings, if he is bound
 to abide by the law of the City. If the good man says
 that he was not summoned, the same must be known
 through the bedel of the Ward. If the bedel says at
 the Hustings that he was summoned, [even] where it
 is proved that the bedel has no other witness, no [wit-
 ness] needs he have, save only the great hell that is rung
 for the Folkmote at St. Paul’s.

 Of Deeds and Testaments enrolled, and of Emine-

 Item, where a reversion or a rent is devised by
 testament enrolled of record in the Hastings, the same
 reversions and rents pass forthwith after the death of
 the testator; so that those to whom such rents are
 devised can distrain for the rent and make avowry
 [as to the same]. And those in lreversion can sue
 their writ of ’ Waste at their pleasure, and without
 attornment by the tenants; and they can plead by the
 same enrolments, if it be necessary, even though they
 have not the said testaments in hand.

 And the same custom holds good as to deeds, inden-
 tures, and other writings, enrolled of record in the
 Hastings. And such enrolments have been used from
 all time; so the testaments be proclaimed and proved
 in full Hustings, as is already “mentioned. And deeds
 and indentures, and other writings under seal, may be
 received, and wgnimnces and confessions of women as
 to the same, recorded, before the Mayor and one Alder-
 man, or before the Recorder and one Alderman, or
 before two Aldermen, if necessary, as well out of Court
 as in; so that the said deeds, indentures, and other
 writings so acknowledged, be afterwards entered and
 enrolled at some [Court] of Hustings, and the fees
 paid for the same, as the manner is.

 Of Courts of Hastings. Page 181.

 Be it made known, that all lands and tenements,
 rents and services, within the City of London and the
 suburbs thereof, are pleadable at the Guildhall in the
 same City, at the two Hastings; of which the one
 Hastings is called “Hastings of Pleas of Land,” and
 the other Hastings is called “Hastings of Common
 “ Pleas ;” and which Hastings are holden in the said
 Guildhall, before the Mayor and Sheriffs of the same
 city, upon the Monday and Tuesday in each week;
 that is to say, upon Monday, for demanding appearance
 of demandants, and for the award of nonsuits, and the
 allowing of essoins ; and upon Tuesday, for the award
 of defaults, and for p1eading,—certain seasons and Feast-
 days excepted, as well as other reasonable causes, at
 which times no Hastings can be held, by usage of the
 city aforesaid. It should also be known, that the
 Hastings of Pleas of Land must be held one Week
 apart by itself, and that of Common Pleas the next
 week apart by itself, upon the days aforesaid: but the
 enrolments and titles of the said Hastings make men-
 tion of Monday only.

 In Hastings of Pleas of Land are pleaded Writs of
 Right Patent, directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs of
 London; in the case of which writs, such is the pro-
 eedure by the custom of the City; that is to say, the
 tenant or tenants shall ﬁrst have three summonses, at
 the tenements [so] demanded, to the three Hastings of
 Pleas of Land next ensuing after delivery of the writ,
 and that without demanding [presence of] the tenants
 at any of the Hastings aforesaid: and after the three
 summonses completed, [they shall have] three essoins
 at the three other Hastings of Pleas of Land then
 next ensuing. And at the next Hastings after the
 third essoin, if the tenants make default, process shall
 be made against them by Grand Cape; or by Petit

 Cape, after appearance made; and other process, as at
 Common Law.

 And if the tenants appear, the demandants shall
 declare against such tenants in the nature of whatever
 writ they shall please (certain writs excepted, which
 are pleadable [only] at the Hustings of Common Pleas,
 as will be set forth hereaﬂser), without protestation
 being made that they will sue in the nature of any
 writ [in particular]. And the tenants shall have 1"View,
 and shall be essoined after View had, as at Common
 Law. The tenants shall also have essoin after each
 appearance, by custom of the City. And if so be that
 such writ is abated after the View, by exception of
 joint-tenancy or other dilatory exception, and another
 like writ is revived, the tenants, according to the cus-
 tom of the City, shall have View upon the second writ,
 the View before had to the contrary notwithstanding.
 And if the parties plead for judgment, judgment shall be
 given by mouth of their Recorder; and six Aldermen,
 at the least, are wont to be present at each such
 judgment given.

 And each bedel of the City, by notice of his Alderman,
 against each Hustings of Pleas of Land, shall cause to be
 summoned tWelve men having freeholds, of the best and
 most suﬁcient of his Ward, to come to the Guildhall to
 pass upon Inquests if necessary, if there be so many
 persons holding land in the said Ward And if the
 parties pleading proceed to Inquisition, then the Inquest
 shall be taken by persons holding land, having at least
 one freehold in the same Ward in which the tenements
 are situate, or in the three other Wards that are nearest
 to the place where the tenements are ; so that four auﬂi-
 cient men of the same Ward where the tenements are
 situate be sworn upon the same Inquest, if there be so

  

 ' See the Glossary, w. ⁴ View:

 many. And by custom of the City, no damages are
 recoverable upon any such Writ of Right patent.

 And the Inquest may pass upon the same day by such
 common summons of the bedel, if the parties he at issue
 and the jurors attend. And if otherwise, process shall
 be made to cause the Inquest to appear at the Hastings
 of Pleas of land next ensuing, by precept of the Mayor
 directed to the Sheriffs. And the Sheriffs shall act
 ministerially, by command of the Mayor, in serving
 writs and in making execution thereon, notwithstand-
 ing that the original writ be directed to the Mayor and
 Sheriffs in common. And be it known, that as well
 the tenants as the demandants may appoint their
 attorneys at such pleas. And if the demandante de-
 clare against the tenants in the nature of a Writ of
 Right, and the parties proceed to Inquisition as to the
 lesser right, then shall the Inquest be taken by four-
 and-twenty, in the nature of a Grand Assize, according
 as the usage demands; provided always, that six of the
 Ward wherein the tenements are situate, if there be
 so many of the same Ward, be upon such Inquest of
 four-and-twenty. And the tenants, in the case of all
 such writs, may vouch to warranty within the said
 city, as also in a 1foreign county, upon deed shown.
 If the vouchees hold no tenements within the City, and
 if the tenants in such writs vouch to warranty in ‘a
 foreign county,——in which case process cannot be made
 against the vouchees by the law of the said city—
 then the record shall be brought before the J usticiars of
 the Common Bench, at the suit of the demandant;
 and there process shall be made against the vouchee.
 And when the question of voucher shall be determined
 in the said Bench, then the whole suit shall be re-
 manded to the Hustings, there to he proceeded with in
 the pleadings according to the custom of the said city,

 and according to what in certain Statutes is more
 fully contained.

 And also, if the tenants in such writs plead in bar
 a release hearing date in a foreign county, or plead
 other foreign matter that cannot be tried within the
 said city, then the demandant shall cause process to be
 removed into the King's Court, for trial of the said
 matter where it is [so] alleged; and according to what
 is there found, the suit shall be remanded to the
 Hustings, there to be proceeded with according as the
 case demands. During the whole of the mean time,
 the plea shall surcease in the Hustings, in the same
 manner as has been done heretofore.

 And also, it has been the usage heretofore that a man
 might sue at the Hustings of Pleas of Land to have
 execution upon certain judgments given at the Hustings;
 and this by bill in the nature of 'Sci're fam'as, without
 writ.

 And be it known, that the summonses which are to
 be made upon the tenants in such Writs of Right, may
 be made two or three days before the said Hustings,
 or on the Sunday next before such Hustings.

 that the same Sheriffs are ministers to act ofﬁcially

 And if the notice be made and witnessed by the
 Sheriﬂ‘ or his ofﬁcers, the tenants may be essoined

 notice attested, then shall be awarded the Grand

 have the View, although they entered through the hus-
 band of the demandant, and also, notwithstanding that
 the husband died seised. And also, the tenants may
 vouch to warranty, and after each appearance may be
 essoined; and all the other process shall be made as
 in Writ of Right in Hustings of Pleas of Land. And
 if the demandant recovers dower against the tenant, by
 default made or by judgment of law on such Writ of
 Dower, and the same female demandant alleges in a
 Court of Record that her husband died seised,—then
 the Mayor shall command the Sheriffs, by precept, to
 have summoned an Inquest of the venue where the
 tenements are, against the next Hustings of Common
 Pleas; for enquiry if the husband died seised, and as
 to the value of the tenements, and the damages. And
 if she recovers upon Inquisition, inquisition shall be
 held as to the damages by the same Inquest.

 0f Gcwelet. Page 186.

 Item, in Writ of Gavelet the tenants shall have
 three summonses and three essoins; they shall also
 have the View, they may vouch to warranty both
 denizen and foreigner, and they shall be essoined, and
 shall have the other exceptions: and all other process
 shall be made as before declared under Writ of Right
 in Hustings of Pleas of Land; save that, if the tenant
 makes default, then after default the demandant shall
 have judgment to recover and to hold for a year and
 a day; upon condition, that the tenant may appear
 within such year and day next ensuing, and make
 compensation for the arrears, and ﬁnd such surety as

 And within such year and day, the tenant may appear

 And if the tenant does not appear within such year

 knows aught to say why the said demandant should
 not recover the tenements wholly to himself and his
 heirs for ever. And if the tenant does not appear, or
 if he appears and knows not what to say, then judg-
 ment shall be that the demandant shall recover the

 makes default upon the Grand Distress, then instructions
 shall be given to the Sheriﬁ‘s by precept of the Mayor,
 —to the effect that the said Sheriffs shall go to the
 place wasted, and make Inquisition as to the waste
 and damages, according to the Statute; and that they
 shall return the Inquisition at the next Hustings of

 Writ of Error. Page 187.

 Item, in Writ of Error as to judgment given in
 Court before the Sheriffs in personal actions, and in
 Assize of Novel Disseisin or Mort d’Ancestor taken
 before the Sheriﬁ‘s and Coroner, the Writ of Error
 shall be directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs; and the
 Mayor shall issue a precept to the Sheriﬂ's to cause
 the record and process to be brought before the next
 Hustings of Common Pleas, and to cause notice to be
 given to the parties to [appear and] hear the record.
 And after that the record and process shall havebeen
 brought into the Hustings, whether the defendant
 appears upon notice or makes default, the errors shall
 be assigned, and there the judgment shall be aﬂirmed
 or reversed awarding as the law demands.

 .And be it made known, that by usage of the said
 city, when a man is' condemned in debt or attaian of
 damages in any personal action before the Sheriﬂ‘s, and
 brings such Writ of Error, the person who so brings
 the writ ought and has been wont, before being deli-
 vered from prison, to ﬁnd sufﬁcient surety by persons
 residing within the same city, before the Mayor and
 Sheriﬂ's, for paying the money or having his body ready
 in case the judgment is aﬂirmed. And so it shall be
 done, where damages are recovered in Assizes before
 the Sheriffs and Coroner.

 Replegiarc. Page 188.

 Item, in Replegiare the process is such—If any man
 takes a distress on another’s ground within the said
 city, he to whom the goods belong may come to one
 of the Sheriffs, and shall have an ofﬁcer by command
 of the Court, to go to the party who has taken the
 goods; and, if he can have View thereof, to appraise

  

 m1.] PROCEDURE on mm or mums. 25

 the same goods by two reputable men. And then a
 plaint shall be entered on the Sheriﬁ's’ paper to this
 eﬂ'ect,—“ Such person makes plaint against such person
 “ as to his d/istrmea unjwtly taken in his home, or
 “ in his freehold, in such α pari-sk ;” and the same
 party shall there ﬁnd two sufﬁcient pledges to pro-
 secute his suit and to make return of the goods, or the
 value, in case return thereof shall be awarded; and so
 he shall have delivery made thereof. And the parties
 shall have a day named beforehand at the next Hust—
 ings of Common Pleas. And then at the said next
 Hustings of Common Pleas, the Sheriff shall prepare a
 bill containing the whole matter and the plaint, and
 shall carry the same bill to the said Hustings, and there
 it shall be put upon the ﬁle, and the parties shall he
 demanded ; upon which day the one and the other may
 be essoined by common essoin: and upon such day, if
 the plaintiff makes default, return of the goods shall
 be awarded to the ‘avowant; and return in such case
 is awardable by the custom three times, and at the
 third time [the goods are] irreplevisable. And then
 the avowant may have an assize of the same rent,
 even though he was never seised of the said rent before.
 And upon occasion when the avowant makes default,
 then it shall be awarded that the distresses shall re-
 main with the plaintiﬁ‘,-—“ to wit, let the distresses so
 “ remain ”—[but] without recovery of any damages.
 And if so be that the Sheriff cannot have View of
 the distress taken, then he shall certify the same at
 the said Hustings, and there shall ’Withcrnam be
 awarded, and thereupon process shall be made. And
 if the parties appear, and avowry is made, and they
 plead for judgment or for imus by Inquisition; then
 shall judgment be given or process made to summon

 each appearance the parties may be essoined. And if
 a. party claims property in the distress, then let him
 certify the same at the Hastings, and process shall be
 made, upon precept made to the Sheriﬁ‘s, to try such
 right of property, etc. And in case a party is essoined
 of the 1King’s Service in Repleqiare, and at the day
 which he has by essoin makes default or does not bring
 his warranty, he shall incur no penalty thereby.

 Wmlt of Partition. Page 189.

 Item, in Writ aDe Participatiom faciendd, for
 making partition between parceners of tenements in
 London, a close writ shall be directed to the Mayor
 and Sheriﬁ's, setting forth the matter according to
 the form of such writ; and the parties shall have
 notice by precept of the Mayor directed to the said
 Sheriﬁ's. And the tenants may be essoined; and if

 of London, and disseisins made therein within the
 forty weeks, are holden and terminable before the two
 Sheriffs and the Coroner of the said city in common, '
 every Saturday at the Guildhall, except at certain times
 when for reasonable causes such Assizes cannot be
 held. And the process therein is such; that is to
 say, when any man feels himself aggrieved and that he
 has been disseised of his freehold in the said city or
 the suburbs thereof, he shall come to any Hustings,
 held at the Guildhall, or, in default of such Hastings, to
 the Congregation of the Mayor and Aldermen in the
 Chamber of Guildhall, upon any Monday, and shall
 there present a bill. And such bill shall be as follows;
 —“ Such a. person makes plaim of meion against
 “ such a person, as to his freehold, in such a parish of
 “ London, situate in London, or in such a parish in
 “ the suburbs of London,” and the same bill shall be
 enrolled. And another bill De Intrat-sione shall be
 prepared thereupon by the Common Clerk of the City,
 making mention of the title of the Hustings _or of the
 day of Congregation of the Mayor and Aldermen, [and]
 containing all the ﬁrst bill: and this bill so made by
 the Common Clerk, shall then be sent to the Sheriffs or
 to one of them, to make process and do right as towards
 the parties.

 And then, when the bill shall have been so served, on
 the Wednesday next ensuing, namely, the oﬂicer of the
 Sheriff to whom the bill is delivered shall cause to be
 summoned the tenant or tenants named in the said
 bill of Assize, upon view of two freemen of the City,
 and that at the tenements as to which the disseisin is
 made, or at the tenements from which the rent [with-
 held] is alleged to be forthcoming. And there the
 tenants shall be told that they must keep their day
 at the Guildhall on the Saturday then next ensuing, at
 their own peril; and the names of the two snmmoners
 shall be endorsed upon the bill. And then the plain-

 Ρη] ASSIZE or NOVEL mssmsm. 29

 tiﬂ' may sue to array the Assize and to summon the
 jurors against the said Saturday, or against some other
 Saturday afterwards, at his will. And so may the
 tenants sue for their deliverance, if they please; and
 such summons shall be made on the Friday before the
 said Saturday. And the array of the panels of jurors
 shall be made by the Sheriffs and their oﬂicers, or else
 by the Mayor and Aldermen, if any one of the parties
 for reasonable cause shall think proper to pray the
 same. And after this, the said Assizes shall he pleaded

 and regulated, for the most part, as elsewhere at ‘

 Common Law.

 And if a release hearing date in a foreign county,
 bastardy, or some other foreign matter that cannot be
 tried in the said city, be alleged at such Assizes, then
 the plaintiﬂ‘s may sue to have the record removed into
 the Court of our lord the King, to try the matter
 there according as the case may demand. And when
 the matter shall have been determined in the King’s
 Court, the entire process shall be remanded to the said
 Sheriffs and Coroner, or to their successors, to be pro-
 ceeded with according to the custom of the City, in
 such manner as has been done heretofore. And be it
 made known, that there is no discontinuance wrought
 in such Assizes, nor is there any mention made in
 the record of the mesne days between the Assize [ﬁrst]
 brought and the day on which the Assize is [again]
 brought or judgment given, unless it be for some neces-
 sary reason, or that such Assizes have been adjourned
 for especial causes. And when the Assizes are taken
 before the Sheriffs and Coroner, as aforesaid, and judg-
 ment has been given thereupon, then shall such Assizes
 so determined be entered of record; and afterwards,
 they shall be brought to the Chamber of the Guildhall,
 to remain in the Treasury there as of record. And be

 then is such force to be ousted. And the parties then
 may come before the Mayor and Aldermen, and may
 there shew their case, their evidences, and their muni-
 ments ; and there it shall be ordered by the said Mayor
 and Aldermen, at their discretion, which party shall be
 adjudged to be in possession for the time, and which
 shall be adjudged to enter suit; saving always unto

 tion of the Mayor and Aldermen; and this bill shall‘

 be sent to the Sheriﬁ's, or to one of them, to serve
 the same according to custom. And the said bill shall
 be served by some seljeant or other oﬁicer of the Sheriff;
 that is to say, the said oﬁoer, on the Wednesday next
 alter delivery of the *bill, shall make summons to the
 tenants, at the tenements demanded, by witness of two
 freemen of the City, that they appear at the Guildhall on
 the Saturday then next ensuing, to hear the recognizance,
 if they think proper [so to do]. Against which Saturday
 the demandant may sue, on the Friday next before,
 to array and summon the jurors; and the like alter-
 wards, against the [following] Saturdays, from fortnight
 to fortnight, at his will. And so also may the tenants
 sue, if they think proper, for their deliverance. ’ ’
 And the arrays of the panels of such Assizes shall be
 made by the Sheriﬂ‘s and their oﬂicers, or by the
 Mayor and Aldermen, if any one of the parties shall
 think proper upon reasonable cause to demand it, in
 manner as the usage is in the Assize of Fressheforce.
 And in such Assizes of Mort d’Ancestor, the parties
 may essoin as at Common Law, and the tenants may
 vouch to warranty within the City, and also in a foreign

 county if the lvouchee has no tenements within the‘

 City. And if the tenants plead a release bearing date
 in a foreign county, or other foreign matter that
 cannot be tried within the City, or if they vouch to
 warranty in a foreign county one who has no possessions

 in the City, then, at the suit of the other party, the ‘

 record shall be removed into the Court of our lord the
 King, by writ directed to the said Sheriﬂ‘s and Coro-
 ner ; and there shall such foreign pleas and foreign
 vouchers be tried and determined, and then remanded
 to the said Sheriﬂ‘s and Coroner, to continue and he
 proceeded with according to the custom of the City.

 Of tlw Days of sitting of the Sheriﬁs’ Court. Page 199.

 In the ﬁrst place, be it made known that the said
 Sheriffs hold Courts of our‘ lord the King before them,
 in the Guildhall of London, and pleas of debt of any
 sum whatever and of all other personal actions, at the
 suit of parties. And each of such Sheriffs holds his
 Court at the said Guildhall severally and by himself
 apart; and that, upon plaints and declarations made
 before the one and the other of the said Sheriffs, as well
 in their own Comptcrs as at the said Guildhall, according
 to the custom of the city aforesaid. And each of the
 said Sheriffs is wont to hold by himself, apart, two
 General Courts in the week; as also daily, for de-
 liverance of foreigners and strangers, if necessary; unless
 they be interrupted by Feast-days or other reasonable
 causes.

 Of Capias. Page 199.

 And it is the usage for the clerks and oﬂicers of the
 said Sheriffs, forthwith upon plaint made, to award
 Capias and other process against defendants, upon testi-
 mony of scijeants of the said oﬂice thereunto deputed,

 as well at the said Compters as at the Guildhall. And
 it is the usage to award Capias in plaints of Debt,
 Account, [and] Covenant, and in all other personal
 actions whatsoever.

 Further as to Award of Capias. Page 199.

 And the person who is so arrested, at the suit of a
 party for debt or other personal action, may ﬁnd
 lmainprise at the said Compters or elsewhere, before
 the Sheriﬂ‘s or their clerks thereunto deputed, that
 he will appear at the next Court holden at the said
 Guildhall before the same Sheriﬁ‘ before whom the
 plaint has been made; upon condition that, if the
 defendant does not appear at the said next Court to
 keep his day, then he shall be condemned in the debt
 in the said plaint contained; save that the plaintiff; if
 he be present, or can conveniently be made to appear
 in Court, shall be examined on his oath as to what
 sum is clearly due to him, and on what grounds:
 beyond which sum found due upon such examination,
 the plaintiff shall recover nothing, except his damages,
 which shall be adjudged to him upon taxation by the
 Court, or by Inquest, if it be necessary. And if the
 defendant be not found, then shall the mainpernors
 be taken and charged with the debt and damages

 made by bill as to the cause of suit, and the amount of
 such damages and such lien. And upon this, an Inquest
 of ofﬁce shall be summoned as to such lien, to tax the
 damages for the plaintiff. And if the defendant be not
 found, then the mainpernors shall be charged, as before.
 And if the Court can be clearly assured by the same
 Inquest, or upon suﬁicient examination of the plaintiff, n
 that the defendant is not guilty, in such case the plaintiﬁ'
 shall recover nothing, notwithstanding the default.

 And when any such mainpemors are arrested and
 committed to prison, because their principals are not
 found; nevertheless, at whatever time such principals
 can be found, and be placed in arrest at the suit of the
 mainpernors, then the said mainpernors shall be set at
 liberty.

 Item, when a man is bodily arrested, and ﬁnds main-
 prise to appear at his day; or puts himself upon Inquest,
 or pleads for judgment, and ﬁnds mainpernors to wait
 until such suit is determined, according to the custom of
 the City; still, at whatever time the chief mainpernors
 shall choose to come to the Court of Record, or to the
 Compter, in which the plea is pending, and surrender
 the body of him for whom they have so become main-
 pcrnors, they shall be duly received, and shall from
 thenceforth be discharged of their mainprise.

 And if a man is arrested on plaint of account, and ﬁnds

 of the plaintiff and the mainpemors. And the main-
 pemors shall be heard, if they have aught to say in dis-
 charge of the account And if the mainpernors do not
 choose to appear, then the plaintiff shall recover his
 arrears upon examination and oath made by him. *And
 in the same manner it shall be done, if the defendant is
 convicted in account by Inquisition held.

 Of Breach of Sequestration. Page 202.

 And also, if plaint is made against any suﬂioient
 freeman, or against other sufﬁcient man and resi-
 ding within the City, then such defendant shall be
 summoned by any serjeant of the Sheriﬁ‘s to appear at
 the Guildhall to make answer to the plaintiff, at the
 Court of the denizens: at which Court, if he makes
 default, he shall be ameroed, and Grand Distress shall
 be forthwith awarded, by usage of the City; and
 then it shall be awarded that the doors of the defen-
 dant be shut and sealed, until such time as he shall
 be willing to appear, and make answer to the plaintiﬁ‘.
 And at each Court of deniZens that he shall he demanded
 and shall not appear, he shall lose his 1issues. And
 if he breaks the sequestration, and the same is attested
 by the seijeant in Court, then it shall be awarded
 that the defendant be arrested bodily, and that he
 make 'ﬁne for the contempt. And when he is so
 arrested he shall ﬁnd sufﬁcient sureties for his appear-

 ance at the then next Court to answer the [other]

 party, under the penalty before limited where Capias

 ‘foreign attachment.

 Of Essoim. Page 202.

 And if any parties appear and plead for inquest
 or for judgment, then they shall be ruled according
 to the usages of the City, without having any essoin
 in such personal actions, either before or after. And
 even if such defendant as has pleaded for Inquest
 make default aﬁaer Inquest joined, nevertheless, if
 he afterwards appears when the Inquest is charged,
 he shall have his challenges of the jurors and shall
 set forth his evidences, such default made by him to
 the contrary notwithstanding,

 And after the parties are at issue upon Inquest,
 such parties are not demandable unless the Inquest
 be summoned. But such Inquest may be summoned,
 as well at suit of the defendant as well as at suit
 of the plaintiﬁ‘. And in plea of debt, the defendant
 may wage his law, by usage of the City, [in proof]
 that he owes nothing to the plaintiff ; that is to say,
 if he be a man enfranchised in the City or residing
 within such city, [he may wage his law] “with the

 And if the defendant is a foreigner, a. stranger, and
 non-resident in the City, he may wage and make his
 law with the third hand forthwith, himself named as
 one, [to the effect that] he owes nothing to the
 plaintiff, and so be acquitted. And if he has not
 two men ready to 'make the oath with him, then
 the defendant, at the request of the plaintiff, must go,
 in the custody of a. serjeant of the Court, to the six
 churches nearest to the Guildhall; and in the same
 churches he must swear that the oath which he made
 in the Guildhall was good. And after this, the
 defendant shall be brought back to the Guildhall, and
 shall have his judgment of acquittal; and the plain-
 tiﬂ‘ shall be ameroed. And in the same manner shall
 it be done in other personal actions where wager of
 law may be bad. And where women in such cases
 are impleaded and wage their law, they may make their

 and such executors and administrators, by usage of the

 And when any defendant, in a plea of debt or other
 personal action, wages his law as a freeman of the
 City, and the plaintiff demands how he is free, it be-
 hoves the defendant to allege which he is, free by birth
 or by redemption; and if he says that he is free by
 redemption, the plaintiff may claim that the defendant
 have his record at the next Court. And if he fails
 as to such record, then he shall be attaian and ad-
 judged convicted in the cause. And if the defendant
 alleges that he is free by birth, the plaintiﬂ‘ may say
 that he was not born within the City; and the same
 shall be enquired into by Inquest taken within the said
 city, from the place in which the defendant shall think
 proper to allege that he was born. And this issue is

 Of Foreign Attachments. Page 207.

 Item, when plaint of debt is made before one of the
 said Sheriffs, and it is testiﬁed by the ofﬁcer that the
 defendant has not sufﬁcient assets in the City, and
 allegation is made by the plaintiff that the defendant
 has goods and chattels, or debts in other hands or in
 other keeping within the said city; and it is prayed
 by the same plaintiff that such goods and chattels may
 be arrested and the debts stopped; then, at the suit
 and suggestion of such plaintiff, such goods and chattels,
 wherever they may be found within the City, shall be
 arrested, and the debts stopped in the hands of the
 debtors, at peril of the plaintiff.

 And upon this, the plaintiff shall continue his suit at
 four Courts before the same Sheriff before whom the
 plaint was [ﬁrst] alleged, until such time as the defen-
 dant shall have been four times demanded; and if
 the defendant does not appear at the fourth Court, and
 has made four defaults, then the defaulter’s goods and
 chattels, so arrested, shall be appraised and delivered to
 the plaintiff; and if the goods be not of the same
 value as the debt, then the debts stopped in the hands
 of the debtors shall be levied and delivered to the
 said plaintiff, up to the amount in demand. And such
 arrests of goods and stoppages of monies are called
 “ Foreign Attachments,” according to the custom of the
 City.

 And upon this, the plaintiff shall ﬁnd suﬂicient surety
 to the Court by pledges, before delivery is made to him ;
 the condition being, that he shall make restitution to the
 defendant of the goods and chattels so taken, or of
 the value thereof, and of the monies as to which he has
 so had execution, if so be that the defendant comes to
 the Court within a year and a day next ensuing, and is
 able to discharge and justify himself by law, to the effect
 that he owed nothing to the plaintiff at the time of the

 plaint being made. And [if] the same defendant shall
 think proper to appear within the year and day, as
 before-mentioned, to justify himself and to plead with
 the plaintiff, then he shall have a Scire facias out of
 the same [Court of] Record against the party who has
 had such execution, to give him notice to appear at
 the next Court, if he know aught to say why resti-
 tution shall not be made in manner aforesaid.

 And if be against whom the Scire facias is so sued
 has such notice, and makes default, or if it is testiﬁed
 that he has nothing within the City, ι01· that he can
 receive notice, and he does not appear at the next
 Court, then the person who sued the Scire facias shall
 have restitution of all the goods and chattels so taken,
 or else of the value thereof; as also, of all the monies
 of which the [other] party had delivery, by reason of
 such Foreign Attachment. In the same manner he shall
 have restitution, if he can discharge himself by way of
 plea. And in the same manner shall restitution be made,
 in due proportion, if the defendant can discharge him-
 self by way of plea of a part of the debt, even though
 he shall not be able to discharge himself of the whole.
 And if the party who has had such execution has not
 a sufﬁciency to make restitution in manner aforesaid,
 then his said pledges shall be charged.

 And if he against whom such foreign attachment is
 made does not appear within the year and day to
 justify himself, as already mentioned, then shall he be
 foreclosed from thenceforth. And be it made known,
 that if, during such Foreign Attachments, any other
 person comes into the Court of Record before the fourth
 default is recorded, or before execution is sued, and is
 ready to prove that the goods arrested were his own
 goods at the time of such arrest being made, and still

 the said goods, nor any other person, except himself,
 to the amount of four pence, then he shall be put to
 his proof, and shall make oath in manner ‘aforesaid,
 by his own hand, etc; and he shall have delivery of
 all such goods so arrested, or of part of them, accord-
 ing as he shall have made proof [in reference thereto].

 And* so too, a servant shall have proof as to the
 goods of his master which are in his charge, according
 to the discretion of the Court. And also, if the de-
 fendant in such Foreign Attachment comes into Court
 at the fourth default recorded, or before, he shall be
 admitted to plead with the plaintiff ; and in the same
 manner he shall be admitted, if he comes before exe-
 cution sued, provided the plaintiff be present in Court
 or otherwise have notice. And in the same manner,
 in such cases of Foreign Attachment, those in whose
 hands any goods are so arrested upon suggestion of
 plaintiffs, and those in whose hands any monies are
 stopped, may come into a Court of Record before the
 same Sheriffs, and be excused and discharged upon
 oath by them made, to the effect that they had no
 such goods in their charge, and that they owed no
 money to such defendants, at the time that such ar-
 rests and stoppages were so made [as to the property]
 in their hands.

 produces an obligation hearing date in London, in proof
 of the debt so due to him, whether the said obligation
 be simple, or endorsed, or made by indentures there-
 upon, in such case, by usage of the City, the defendant
 shall not be admitted to plead any acquittance or re-
 lease by the plaintiff hearing date in a foreign county,
 or any payment there made, or condition or other
 matter, but only such matter as can be enquired into
 and tried in the same city. And if any defendant, in
 such case, pleads any such acquittance or release, or
 alleges any payment made or other matter done in a
 foreign county, out of the said city, to oust the Court
 of its jurisdiction, and such defendant thinks proper to
 say nothing else, he shall be barred for default of an-
 swer. But if so be that the endorsement of the obli-
 gation, or the indentures made thereupon, make express
 mention of making or performing any condition or
 other matter elsewhere out of the City, and such
 matter is alleged by the defendant, then the Court
 shall surcease, and the plaintiff shall be told to sue at
 Common Law.

 And alter the same manner is the usage in plaint
 of trespass. And in other personal actions as to bar-
 gains and contracts made in the said city, the de-
 fendants shall not be admitted to plead or allege any
 matter out of the said city, but only such matter as
 can be enquired into and tried within the same city.

 Of an Obligation wiélwut date at a. certain place.
 age 210.

 Item, where an obligation is proﬂ'ered which bears
 date at no certain place, and the plaintiff in declaring
 alleges that the said obligation was made in a certain
 Parish in the City of London, and the defendant on
 his part alleges that such obligation was made in a
 certain place without the City, and is ready to prove
 the same, and therewith pleads foreign matter as to

  

 Pu] AILEGATION 0F PART-PAYMENT. 45

 the same in avoidance of the said obligation; while
 the plaintiﬂ‘ tenders to make proof by the 1country
 that the said obligation was made within the City of
 London, in such manner as he has declared; in such
 case, it is the usage to take the Inquisition in London,
 from the Parish wherein the plaintiff has declared that
 such obligation was made, if the plaintiff prays to that
 eﬂ'ect. And if it be found that the obligation was
 made in London, as the plaintiff has alleged by his
 declaration, then shall the defendant be condemned in
 the debt, and in damages to be taxed by the same
 Inquest.

 Of an Obligation with α double penalty. Page 211.

 Item, where an obligation is made with a double
 penalty by endorsement or by indentures, and the ob-
 ligor is impleaded and acknowledges the obligation,
 and the day of payment has expired, as may be seen
 by the same obligation; yet, nevertheless, the plaintiff
 ought to recover only the clear debt that is in arrear,
 and that by oath of such plaintiﬂ‘, or by lawful infor-
 mation of his attorney, if the plaintiff be not present,
 and not the two-fold amount of the debt that is con-
 tained in the said obligation; and his damages shall
 be taxed for him by the Court according to the time
 that has expired, at its own discretion or else by In-
 quest. And even though the defendant in such case,
 against such obligation made with a double penalty,
 plead that it is not his deed, or that he ’has completed
 the days for payment contained in the endorsement or
 in the indentures made thereon, or other like matter,
 and put himself upon Inquest as to the same, and it
 be found against the defendant by verdict of such In-

 quest; still, the plaintiff shall recover nothing but that
 which is found clearly due by such Inquest, that is to
 say, the single debt and his damages as taxed by the
 same Inquest.

 And if an obligation in the single is produced, and
 the defendant acknowledges the obligation, and the
 day has expired and the defendant alleges that the
 plaintiff has been paid part of the debt; then the
 plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, shall be ex-
 amined upon his oath as to how much is in arrear;
 and in such case, the plaintiff shall recover nothing
 beyond what he shall be willing to swear is due and
 in arrear; and his damages shall be taxed by the
 Court. And if, against such obligation made in the
 single, the defendant pleads that it is not his deed,
 and it is found that it is the deed of the defendant;
 still, the plaintiﬂ' shall recover nothing but what is
 found due by the Inquest, and clearly in arrear, and his
 damages as taxed by the same Inquest. And the defen·
 dant in such ease shall pay a ﬁne for contradicting his
 own deed ; and in the other cases he shall be ¹ amerced.

 Of an Obligation ‘on certain Oonditione.’ Page 212.

 Item, where an obligation is made for payment of a
 certain sum upon divers conditions to be performed,
 by endorsement or by indentures made thereon, and
 plaint is made thereupon, and the parties are at traverse
 and at issue upon some especial condition broken; and
 it is found by Inquest, on wager of the parties, against
 the defendant, to the effect that he is so bound and
 that he has broken the said condition ; still, the plaintiff
 shall not recover the whole sum named in such obliga-

  

 ¹ Le. pay a more moderate sum his own deed; mercements being
 than that exacted for contradicting on a more moderate scale than ﬁnes.

 tion, but he shall recover such damages as he has sus-
 tained by reason of such condition being broken ; and his
 damages shall be taxed by the same Inquest, and the
 obligation shall be saved to him, that he may avail
 himself of the other conditions thereafter. But as to
 this custom some are in doubt.

 Of an Acquittanoe alleged to be in distant parts.
 Page 212.

 Item, if an obligation of debt is produced and the
 defendant alleges that he has an aquittance or inden-
 tures, or other matter under seal of the plaintiff, which
 would avail him and discharge him as against the
 plaintiff, if he had the same ready in hand; and further
 says, that the said muniments are in a foreign county
 and out of the City, and is ready to make oath as to
 the same; then the said defendant, after such oath
 made, shall have a day assigned by the Court to have
 ready his said muniments under seal at a certain Court
 thereaﬂaer, according to the distance from such place,
 and for this shall ﬁnd sureties at his peril; so that, if
 he appears on the said day given and produces the same
 deed under seal, [the existence of] which he alleged,
 he shall then be admitted to plead and to take his
 advantages by virtue of the same deed: and if he
 makes default on such day, or if he fails as to that which
 he has alleged, then he shall be condemned in the
 amount of the said obligation, and damages shall be
 taxed by the Court; saving always, that the plaintiff
 or his attorney shall be examined as to [the amount
 of] the debt.

 freedom; if the plaintiff comes to the Sheriff, and has
 brought with him six or four freemen of the said city,
 and men of credit, who are willing to bear witness
 that the defendant is absconding, and that he wishes
 to withdraw and absent himself; then the said Sheriff,
 upon their testimony, may arrest the defendant by his
 body or by his goods, just the same as a foreigner.

 ¹ Replegz'are. Page 213.

 Item, the Sheriffs may hold before them pleas of
 seizure of naams in lieu of Repleg'iare, and avowry
 be made and return awarded in such pleas, the
 same as in the Hustings, if the cause does not bear
 reference to a freehold. And such suit is called “’De
 “ placito captionis et detentionis catallovwm ;” and
 pledges shall be found to make return of the goods or
 of the value thereof, just as in Replcgia're.

 Item, it is the usage in such personal actions before
 the Sheriffs, that upon the ﬁrst day, when both parties
 appear and the plaintiff has declared against the defen-
 dant, the same defendant shall make answer upon the
 same day, without having any further day to imparl:
 and in the same manner, if the defendant pleads any
 plea or alleges any matter against the plaintiff, the
 same plaintiff shall make replication forthwith, without
 having any further day ’to imparl; unless assent be
 given by the parties.

 Item, if any customs or usages are pleaded or alleged
 in the Sheriﬂ‘s’ Courts, as to which neither the Sheriffs
 nor their oﬂicers are fully informed, then such customs
 and usages shall be discussed by the Mayor and Alder-
 men, and that, before judgment given thereupon.

 And be it made known, that there is no adjournment
 made in the Sheriffs’ Court, and no day given by pre-
 vious notice; but only that the parties are to keep
 their day at the next Court generally, unless such be
 not the case for some especial cause.

 Item, actions of debt are maintainable by usage
 upon simple grants, and assignments, and bailment,
 and covenant. made simply without specialty.

 Of a Sealed Tally. Page 214:.

 Item, a sealed tally of debt by usage of the City is
 as binding as an ‘obligation; and in cases where plaint
 of debt is made, and such sealed tally is proffered in
 proof of the debt, the defendant shall not have his
 law in proof that he owes nothing, or any other matter,
 any more than against an obligation; still, he shall
 be at liberty to assert that the day of payment is
 other than the plaintiff has declared.

 Of Recognizances 130 be taken by the Shemfs.
 age 215.

 Item, the Sheriff's of London are wont, and each of
 them by himself, to take recognizances of debt in
 their Courts as to any sum whatever ; and if the day
 of payment is expired and the money not paid, then,
 at the suit of him to whom the recognizance was
 made, if it be within the year, all the goods and chattels
 of the reeognizor found within the City shall be ap-
 praised and delivered to such other party, up to the
 amount of the debt contained in the said recognizance,
 without 2extending any land of the recognizer. And
 if the year be expired, then Scire facias shall be issued

 Of Custody of Prisoners condemed. Page 215.

 Item, the Sheriffs may, by usage, keep any prisoners
 condemned before them, or committed to their keeping,
 [conﬁned] as well at their houses where they are residing,
 and at their Compters, as in the common gaols; so
 that they be always kept in safeguard, and not going
 at large from out of the houses or of the Compters
 aforesaid

 0f Phas between Mmhant muz harem. Page 215.

 Item, in plaints of debt and account, and other
 personal contracts made between merchant and mer-
 chant, if the plaintiff declares that the defendant at
 any market-town, or at any place of merchandize within
 the realm, bargained for or bought of the same plaintiff
 any merchandize, or received his money for the pur-
 pose of paying him, delivering, or rendering to him to
 account thereof, in any place within the City of London;
 in such case, the defendant, according to usage, shall be
 put to his answer, notwithstanding that such contract
 was made out of the City; and if the parties are at
 traverse and plead for issue thereon by Inquisition,
 then shall the Inquest be taken from people of the
 said city, that is to say, from merchants passing be-
 tween the said city and the market-town where such
 contract is alleged [to have been made]; to the
 intent that such merchants who are so passing may
 have ‘notice of the said contract

 Of the same. Page 216.

 Item, the Sheriff's of London have been wont for
 all time to hold pleas before them between any mer-
 chants whomsoever, in cases where both parties are
 merchants, as to all bargains and personal contracts
 that concern merchandize, made beyond sea at any
 market-town or at any place of merchandize, where
 such bargains and contracts are made by express words
 as to payments for, or delivery of, merchandize, or as
 to rendering account in the said City of London.
 And in such case, if the parties have recourse to issue
 by Inquisition, then shall the Inquest be taken from
 persons residing within the said City, that is to say,
 from merchants passing to and fro, who are wont to
 pass beyond sea; who may best have knowledge of
 the bargains and contracts aforesaid And if any
 merchant-stranger and alien is a party to the plea,
 and such Inquisition has to be taken, then the alien
 merchant shall have a moiety of the Inquest of his
 own tongue.

 Item, if a. plaint of debt is made, and it is testiﬁed
 by the ofﬁcer that the defendant is not residing within
 the City, but that he has withdrawn himself and has
 removed his goods, and it is testiﬁed that he has
 lands or tenements within the said city; then, at the
 suit of the plaintiff, after the fourth default, the same
 lands and tenements, by usage of the City, shall be
 ‘extended and delivered to the said plaintiﬁ', to hold
 the same upon the same extent until he shall have levied
 therefrom the monies that are due to him; be ﬁnding

 security duly to maintain the tenements, and also to
 repay the defendant the monies received therefrom in
 the meantime; if so be that the same defendant shall
 come into a Court of Record within a year and a day
 after delivery made, and be able to discharge him-
 self [by shewing] that he owes nothing to the
 plaintiff.

 0f Examination in a Personal Plea. Page 217.

 Item, the Sheriﬂ's are wont to examine the parties in
 all personal actions that are pending before them, if
 either of the parties prays the same, and to proceed to
 judgment according to what has been found upon such
 examination.

 Item, where any personal action is pending before
 either of the said Sheriﬂ‘s, and any matter is alleged
 by the defendant in bar of the action, or any material
 thing to delay the plaintiff, and the plaintiff puts
 himself upon the peremptory oath of the defendant,
 [in proof] that the plea or exception presented by the
 same defendant is not true; then the said defen-
 dant, if he is in Court, or if he is resident in the City
 so as conveniently to appear at the discretion of the
 Court, shall be put upon his oath, if he will, that his
 plea or exception so made is good and true. And if
 he appears and refuses to make such oath, then he shall
 be held as though convicted in the cause; and upon
 this, the plaintiff shall recover what is in demand
 according to what shall be ascertained by examination
 of such plaintiﬁ; or by Inquest of ofﬁce if need be.
 And if [the defendant] makes the oath, the plaintiff
 shall be cast in his suit.

 And in the same manner shall the plaintiff be cast
 in his suit or in his action, if he will not swear
 on his part that his suit, or such other matter
 as is alleged by him, is good and true. And if such
 oath is put to the plaintiff, and the plaintiﬂ‘ makes the

 rrL] ACl‘ION 0F ACCOUNT. 53

 oath, he shall recover by such oath, if the exception
 be material. And thus are such oaths peremptory on
 the one side and on the other, according to the matter
 in the exceptions.

 Of Default made after Mainprise. Page 218.

 Item, if a man is arrested upon plaint of debt or
 for other personal action, and he ﬁnds mainprise to be
 ready to appear before the Sheriﬁ's at the next Court,
 to make answer to the [other] party; even if at such
 Court the defendant is demanded at the proper time to
 appear and save his mainprise, and he makes default,
 and such default is recorded; still, if the same de-
 fendant appears [at last], while the same Court is
 sitting, he shall be admitted to plead; save that, in
 such case he has lost the advantage of waging his law,
 even though he might have had his wager of law had
 he appeared in due time.

 Note here—0f the Amendment of Bille. Page 218.

 Item, where the parties appear in the Sheriﬂ's’ Court,
 it is the usage that the plaintiffs may amend their
 plaints and their bills at any time before the same
 parties are at issue, or have pleaded for judgment, in
 [such] Court of Record. ⁷

 Action of Account. Page 218.

 Item, in an action of account before the Sheriﬁ's, tho
 plaintiff, by usage of the City, may not declare in any
 case that the defendant was his bailee, but that, he was
 receiver of his monies or of his goods.

 Item, an action of account is maintainable by usage
 against a single woman, and against infants under age,
 if they are merchants or if they keep common shops
 for trade or for merchandize; as also actions of debt,
 in the same manner, as to that which concerns their
 trading or their merchandize.

 Item, where pleas are pending before the Sheriﬂ‘s, it
 has been the usage for all time, that the Mayor of
 London, for the time being, may send unto the Sheriff‘s
 to cause the suit and process to be brought before
 himself and the Aldermen, in order to determine and
 discuss the same suit before them; or may remand the
 said suit before the same Sheriﬂ‘s, that procedure may
 be continued according as the Mayor and Aldermen
 shall see proper to do; ιοι· he may command the
 Sheriﬁ's to surcease the same at their own pleasure.

 Ihm; How that the Debtor may be arrested before the day

 Item, when a debtor is bound within the said city
 by an obligation to pay a certain sum on a certain
 day to come, the which debtor was held to be sum—
 cient at the time when he entered into such obligation,
 andhas since become a runaway or non-sufﬁcient ; then,
 if the creditor comes before the Mayor or Sheriffs of
 the said city, making suggestion to such eﬁ'ect, and.
 brings with him six or four trustworthy persons of the
 same city, who are ready lawfully to testify that the
 debtor wishes to withdraw himself and to remove his
 goods from the City, or that he is not of ability to
 make payment; then the Mayor or one of the Sheriff's,
 before whom the suggestion is made, is wont to arrest
 the debtor, even though the day contained in the obli-
 gation have not arrived, and to detain the same debtor

 otherwise until he shall ﬁnd pledges that he will await

 Item, if a freeman of the City ﬁnds his debtor sud-
 denly within the same city, which debtor has before
 withdrawn himself or is about to abscond, and such
 debtor should wish to escape before the creditor can
 ﬁnd an oﬂicer to make the arrest; it is the usage in
 such case that the freeman himself by aid of his neigh-
 bours, without any oﬂicer, may arrest his said debtor
 and bring him to the oﬂice of one of the Sheriﬁ's, and
 there make his suit as the law demands.

 Of Awwroemmt-s. Page 220.

 Item, touching the amercements to be taken upon
 plaints made in the Sheriﬁ‘s’ Courts, it is theusage, if
 the demands are for forty shillings or less, to’ take four
 pence for the amercement; and if they exceed forty

 shillings, it is the usage to take twelve pence for the
 amercement.

 and wish to go out and give up possession of their
 houses, they shall give notice to the lessor before their
 departure; that is to say, as to houses that are rented
 for forty shillings and under, notice shall be given one
 quarter before. And if the rent of the house exceeds
 forty shillings, the notice shall be given half a year
 before the departure, at peril of the tenant. And
 in the same manner shall notice be given unto the
 tenant, if the lessor wishes to be rid of the tenant.

 party who has so recovered may elect to have the
 body of him who is condemned committed to prison
 until he shall have made satisfaction, or to have
 execution of his goods, at his own peril.

 Item, jurors who are summoned upon Inquisition
 are not ameroed, even though they make default, in
 more than three pence; but if they tarry a long time
 and are not willing to appear, the Sheriffs, according
 to usage, may close their doors to constrain them to

 Inquests of oﬂice not travereable. Page 223.

 Item, Inquests of oﬂice that are taken by the She-

 new Inquests; but at the suit of 0. party, each party
 shall have his answer, such Inquest of ofﬁce notwith-

 that Scavage is so called as being a ‘shewing ’;
 because it behoves the merchants that they shew unto
 the Sheriﬂ's the merchandize for which the custom is
 to be taken, before that any of it be sold. And be it
 made known, that as to all wares, for which custom shall

 shall weigh three hundredweight; and pepper, the
 which kark shall weigh three hundredweight and a

 And be it remembered, that it is only for merchandize
 coming from beyond sea that the aforesaid Scavage
 ought to be taken: butlfor thearticles of merchandize
 here-under written, nothing ought to be taken, for
 the reason aforesaid; wax, for example, ¹ argoil, copper,
 tin, 2grey-work, and other articles of merchandize
 which the merchants of Almaine bring, provided they
 do not bring those above-written; that is to say, those
 which owe Scavage, as is before noticed. And be it
 made known, that Scavage ought to be taken for
 such articles of merchandize as come into the City by
 merchants 3who owe custom.

 Of Pesage. Page 226.

 Unto Pesage it pertaineth, that each article of mer-
 chandize that shall be sold by weight, when brought into
 the City by merchant-strangers, and sold in gross by
 the hundredweight or by half hundredweight, ought to
 be weighed by the King’s beam; in which case, the
 buyer shall pay unto the Sheriffs, for one hundred-
 weight weighed, one halfpenny; and for several hun-
 dredweight weighed he shall pay no more, up to a
 thousand-Weight, and then for such thousand-weight he
 shall pay one penny ; and for eleven hundredweight he
 shall pay three halfpence, and no more up to two
 thousand-weight ; and then, for such two thousand-
 weight weighed he shall pay two pence, and so on.
 And be it made known, that the buyer shall always at
 his own cost cause the King’s beam and weights to he
 brought to the house where the vendor is harboured;
 so that the vendor shall pay nothing to any one by
 reason aforesaid.

 ΡΠ] CUSTOM PAYABLE FOR TRONAGE. 6l

 Of Tronage. Page 226.

 Unto Tronage pertain those things which are weighed
 by the King’s tron, as also many things that are not
 weighed at all (that is to say, the custom due upon
 wine, woad, and other things) : thus, for a sack of wool,
 three weys in weight, going out of London to the
 parts beyond sea, by merchants who owe custom, the
 Sheriff ought to have eleven pence [for Tronage]; and
 if there is more wool contained in such sack than three
 weys and a half, or four weys, the Sheriff shall take
 for it for the sack no more than eleven pence. And if the
 merchant has several sacks of the said weight going out
 of the City, the Sheriff shall take for the ﬁrst sack eleven
 pence, and for each of the others ten pence. For a
 sack of two weys going out of the City by merchants
 who are liable to custom, the Sheriff shall receive six
 pence. And if the merchant has several [such] sacks,
 then he shall take for the ﬁrst sack six pence in manner
 aforesaid, and for each of the others ﬁve pence; and
 if in a sack there is contained more than two weys, he
 shall take no more, unless it contain twelve cloves.
 But if it contains more than twelve cloves, then the
 Sheriff shall take for it as much as for a sack of three
 weys, that is to say, eleven pence. And be it made
 known, that ¹ worsted in sacks owes the Sheriff nothing,
 except in manner aforesaid; that is to say, if in a
 sack of two weys the worsted weighs more than twelve
 cloves, then he shall take for the same eleven pence, in
 manner as is before stated

 0f the Weighing of Wool. Page 227.

 The merchant may lawfully make his election not to
 weigh with the King’s tron,if he pleases, and [in such
 case] he shall pay no more than has been stated. And

 has the word been met with.

 if his wool has not been [so] weighed, he shall not pay
 less than the custom aforesaid.

 of ’the Sale of Wool. Page 227.

 For wool that is to be sold in the City, even
 though it be brought by merchants who are liable to
 custom, [the Sheriﬁ'] ought not to have Tronage; nor
 yet for lead, or for lard, or for other things that shall
 be weighed by tron. But at the will of the vendor
 and the buyer, they may be weighed by the other trons
 in the seld, and by whichever tron they may please.

 For each tun of Wine coming into the City by
 merchants who owe custom, the Sheriff takes two
 pence.

 For each quarter of woad going out of the City,
 the Sheriff takes one halfpenny; which thing [how-
 ever] does not pertain unto Tronage.

 0f Woad. Page 228.

 It should also be known, that in ancient times no
 woad used to be harboured in the City,. but all was
 sold in the vessels. In times that are [long] past,
 the merchants harboured their weed, renting the ware-
 houses by leave of the Sheriffs. After this, in the
 time when Andrew Bokerelle was Mayor, by assent of
 the greatest persons of the City, the merchants of
 1Amias, of Nele, and of Corby, obtained a letter sealed
 with the Common Seal of the City, by which it was
 granted unto them that they might at all times, and
 whenever they might please, harbour their weed, and
 for the same should pay unto the Mayor ﬁfty marks
 sterling per a/nnum ; that is to say, at the Fair of Saint
 Ives 25 marks, and at the Fair of Wyncestre 25 marks.
 And at a still later period, they were to pay one

 . halfpenny for each quarter of woad, as is before stated

 The merchants of Normandy pay a ﬁne unto the
 Sheriffs for leave to harbour their woad. But never-
 theless, it was provided at the 1time when Thomas
 Fitz-Thomas and Matthew Bokerelle were Sheriffs,—
 when they were making outrageous demands upon the
 merchants for the said leave,—that ﬁ'om thenceforth
 they should pay unto the Sheriffs seven shillings for
 each frail, for leave to harbour; and at a still later
 period, one halfpenny for custom, as is before stated.

 Of Vessels with ² bulwarke. Page 229.

 From every vessel with bulwarks that anchors in
 the Thames, the Sheriff takes two pence; and even
 though she should anchor in several places, he shall
 take no more, if it so happen that she does not anchor
 within the limits of Queen-Hythe. And in such case,
 [the vessel] shall pay unto the Warden of that hythe
 two pence for custom.

 For the rent of the Cemetery that is called the
 ‘ New Cemetery,’ the person who collects Scavage takes
 one mark per a/MW/m to the use of the Sheriﬂ's, at
 the four terms of the year.

 For the ferm of the people of Cologne, that is to

 The King’s Prisage upon wines—If nine tuns of wine,
 or less than nine, come in a ship or in a boat, the King’s
 Chamberlain ought to take nothing for the King’s Pri-
 sage, as of right. And if ten tuns come, he shall take
 one tun; and if there are nineteen tuns, he ought to take
 nothing upon account of Prisage beyond one tun; and
 upon twenty tuns he shall take two. And if one
 hundred or two hundred tuns come together in one
 ship, the Chamberlain shall take for the King’s Prisage
 only two tuns. And if a great ship that comes with
 wines desires to unload into boats before it arrives [at
 the wharf], and follows the boats, with the remaining
 wines, to the wharf, the Chamberlain ought to take
 for the ship and the boats only a single Prisage. And if
 the mariners of the ship or of the boat can shew that
 the King’s Prisage has been taken at lSandwiz, or at
 any other seaport, by the Chamberlain or by any other
 bailiﬂ' acting on behalf of the King, the Chamberlain
 ought to take nothing at London; but throughout all
 dominions of the King the merchants to whom such
 wines belong, ought to go quit by reason of the ﬁrst
 Prisage.

 When nineteen or nine tuns come to London by boat,
 it is fully lawful for the Chamberlain to take the assur-
 ance or the oath of the merchants to whom such wines
 belong, that they do not cause the wine to arrive in
 such manner, by small quantities, for the purpose of
 avoiding or of withdrawing the King’s Prisage.

 assize of bread, and of ale, and of other victuals, and
 as to various trades, in the City of London, that ought
 each year, after the Feast of Saint Michael, to be
 proclaimed throughout the said City]

 In the ﬁrst place, that the peace of God and the
 peace of our Lord the King shall be well kept and
 maintained among denizens and strangers; and that
 the places and the lanes of the City shall be kept
 clear of all manner of annoyance, such as dung, rub-
 bish, pigsties, and other annoyances, under heavy
 penalties. And that all manner of victuals that are
 sold by persons in Chepe, upon Cornhulle, and else-
 where in the City, such as bread, cheese, poultry,

 Also, as to corn-dealers who bring corn unto the City
 for sale—that no one shall sell by show or by sample
 But they shall come to certain places in the City esta-
 blished with their carts laden, and with their horses
 having the loads upon them, without selling anything
 and without getting rid of anything, until [they
 reach] the established places; that is to say, within
 the Gate of Newgate, before the Friars Minors [there,
 and] at Graschirche; and this, without putting any-
 thing into house or into hiding-place, whether the
 same arrive by night or by day. And that no corn shall
 be sold until the hour of Prime rung at Saint Paul’s,

 peasants to take the corn to their house, and that there
 they shall receive their pay—And when they come
 [there] and' think to have their payment directly, the
 buyer says that his wife 'at his house has gone out,
 and has taken the key of the room, so that he cannot
 get at his money; but that the other must go away,
 and come again soon and receive his pay. And when
 he comes back a second time, then the buyer is not [to
 be] found; or else, if he is found, he feigns something
 else, by reason whereof the poor men cannot have their
 pay. And sometimes, while the poor men are waiting
 for their pay, the buyer causes the corn to be 1wetted;
 and when they come to ask for their pay, which was
 agreed upon, [they are told] to wait until such a day
 as the buyer shall choose to name for them, or else to
 take oﬁ' a part of the price ; which if they will not do,
 they may take their corn and carry it away; a thing
 which they cannot do, because it is wetted, [and] in
 another state than it was in when they sold it. And
 by such evil delays on part of the buyer, the poor men
 lose half of their pay in expenses before they are
 fully settled with.—

 Of shutting the doors of Taverners and Brewers at
 proper hours. Page 276.

 And whereas such persons, going about by night, do
 commonly have their resort and hold their common
 meetings in taverns more than elsewhere, and do there
 seek shelter, and lie in wait and watch their time to
 do ill ;—it is forbidden that any person shall keep a
 tavern for wine or for ale open after the hour of curfew
 aforesaid; but they shall keep their taverns closed aﬂaer
 that hour. Nor shall they have any persons therein,
 sleeping or sitting up; nor shall any one receive [per-
 sons] into his house from out of a common tavern, by

 willing to be answerable unto the peace of the King.

 otherwise, let him be put on his surety, the ﬁrst time
 by the ¹ hanap of the tavern, or by some other good
 pledge therein found; and let him be amerced in the
 sum of forty pence. And if a second time it shall
 be found that he has oﬂ'ended, let him be amerced in
 the sum of half a mark; and the third time, in ten
 shillings. The fourth time let him pay the whole

 bad character, knowing that he has been a transgres-
 sor, let him have the imprisonment that is provided
 for all receivers of felons. And it is provided, that
 every Alderman, in his Wardmote, shall diligently
 enquire as to misdoers resorting to and staying in his
 Ward; and if any such persons shall be found by pre-
 sentment and indictment of the good folks of the
 Ward, let them be forthwith bodily attached; and
 that by the Aldermen, if the Sheriff's or their bailiffs
 are not present. But if they are present, they are
 to do the same by command of the said Aldermen;
 and let [such persons] be brought before the Mayor
 and Aldermen, and be interrogated as to that for which
 they are indicted, and which is presented against them.
 And those who cannot clear themselves, let them be
 punished by imprisonment or other punishment, at
 their discretion, according to that which the offence
 demands.

 And every Alderman is to hold his Wardmote, in
 all points as heretofore they have done, that is to
 say, four times in the year.

 That persons arrested1 for some grievous cause shall not
 be released without assent of the Mayor. Page 277.

 And it is provided, that no boatman shall have his

 doers may not be carried by them, under pain of
 imprisonment: nor may they carry any man or woman,
 either denizens or strangers, unto the lStews, except

 For the safe-keeping of the City it is ordained,
 that from henceforth, in place of the Mayor, there
 shall be a Warden appointed by the King, and Sheriffs
 and Aldermen by the Treasurer and the Barons of the
 Exchequer; the which shall all be obedient and sworn
 unto the King to keep watch and ward, and to main- “
 tain the peace in such form as they shall be charged [to
 do] : that is to say, to preserve the peace by night and
 by day, and to cause the watches and the waits to be

 set, according to the points under-written: and that
 the Sheriﬂ's, Aldermen, and all the people shall be
 wholly obedient unto the Warden.

 And the King doth will and command, to preserve
 the peace in his city, that if any felony shall be com-
 mitted within the City or offence against his peace,
 each person who shall be near when such offence or
 felony is committed within the City, or who shall
 hear, or see, or know of, offence against his peace
 or felony [committed], shall arrest or attach such
 felons or transgressore* to the utmost of his power;
 and if he have not power to do the same forthwith,
 let him raise hue and cry against the misdoers. Upon
 which hue and cry, the King doth will and command
 that all those who shall be near and shall hear the
 cry, shall come upon the cry for the taking and
 arresting of such felons and misdoers. And so soon as
 they shall be taken, let them be delivered unto the
 bailiffs of the King. And he who comes not on hue
 and cry raised, let him be heavily amerced.

 And if it so happen that any felon escapes unto a
 church before he is taken, let the folks of the Ward,
 where the church is situate unto which such felon has
 betaken himself, keep watch upon that felon, until
 such time as he shall have been made to ‘quit the
 realm, in case the folks of the Ward suﬂice there-
 unto; and if not, let them have aid of the nearest
 neighbours and of the Wards adjoining unto that
 Ward, according to the ordinance and counsel of the
 Warden of the City; care being taken that no person
 shall with such watch be unreasonably charged.

 reason whereof this Ordinance may not be observed.
 And as to those who shall be convicted of such
 offences as battery, or bloodshed, where death or
 1mayhem lieth not, let them also be punished by
 ﬁne; and more especially, by imprisonment, at the
 discretion of those before whom the offence shall be
 judged; to the end that the severity of such punish-
 ment may cause dread in others to offend. And always
 let them have regard to the extent of the offence, and
 to the extent to which they are culpable and in the
 habit of offending or not.

 And let each person beware of raising hue and cry
 upon aﬁ‘ray in the City by day or by night, without
 reasonable occasion. And if any one shall do so, and
 thereof be attainted, let him be punished according to
 the offence.

 And if any misdoer shall escape from a church, let
 those who ought to have kept watch be held answer-
 able unto the King in one hundred shillings for
 escape: and this is to be understood as to escapes
 made from churches in the City. And as to escapes
 from N ewgate, let the same be as they have been
 heretofore.

 country; and of such, some beCOme brokers, hostelers,

 some of such know nothing but how to go up and
 down about the streets, more by night than by day,
 and are well attired as to clothing and array, and feed
 upon delicate meats and costly; and they follow no
 trade or merchandize, nor have lands or tenements
 by which they may live, or friends who may ﬁnd
 them, and are continually removing from one house
 to another: and through such persons do arise many
 of the perils in the City, and many of the evils.
 And some are found openly offending; as by rob-
 beries and other evil deeds—It is [therefore] provided,
 that no person of a strange land, or other person,
 shall be a herbergeour or hosteler within the City,
 unless he be a freeman, within the City admitted, and
 conﬁrmed by the Warden, and Mayor, and Aldermen,
 as a good and lawful man; or unless he have good
 testimony from the place whence he shall have come,
 and have rightfully come and lawfully departed there-
 from, and ﬁnd safe sureties amenable unto the Bailiﬂ‘s
 of the City, to be answerable unto the King’s peace
 and unto the citizens of the City, for keeping [the
 same] without harm.

 And if perchanoe any person of a strange land, by
 the surety that he ﬁnds, or by the freedom that has
 been granted unto him of the City, is about to be-
 come a hosteler or herbergeour within the City, let
 him make provision to reside in the heart of the
 City, according to the tenor aforesaid; [and if any
 such persons shall be doing otherwise], within forty
 days next ensuing after the day on which these
 Articles shall be read and published in the City, let
 them forego the same and withdraw themselves, that
 they do so no longer. And if any person shall be
 found contravening the form aforesaid after the forty
 days aforesaid, let him lose the freedom for ever, and
 nevertheless let him be punished with imprisonment,
 according as the offence demands.‘

 And whereas thieves and other persons of light and

 the City than elsewhere, through whom evil deeds and
 murders, by reason of such harbouring, do oﬁen happen,
 and great evils and scandals to the people of the City,
 —the doth will and command, that from hence-
 forth no common woman shall dwell within the walls
 of the City. And if any such shall hereafter be found
 within the City residing and dwelling, let her be

 search to be made throughout the City in the best
 manner that he shall see ﬁt, where such women are w
 ceived, and who they are; and then, when they shall
 be found, let their limits be ’ assigned unto them.
 And let no [such person] from henceforth wear minever
 [or ¹ cendal] on her dress or on her hood ; and if any
 one shall do so, let her lose the minever and the
 cendal. And as to such minever and cendal, let the
 same be forfeited unto the serjeant who shall ﬁnd

 defend, and presented by the folks of the Ward unto
 the Alderman; before whom they shall make oath
 well and lawfully to keep ward, [and], without favour to
 any one, [or] corruption through either gift or aﬂinity,
 to arrest and attach those who act and go about by
 night, in breach of the peace and, in contravention of
 the tenor of the proclamation made, and lawfully to pre-
 sent the same before the Warden or Mayor; before
 whom, according to their oﬂ‘ence, let such persons be
 punished. And towards the sustenance of such per-
 sons, let all such make contribution as shall be hostelers
 and housekeepers in such Ward, ofﬁcers of the King
 excepted. And if, any of those sworn, who keep watch,
 shall be attainted of not having duly kept watch, or of
 having shown favour unto any one who for his offence
 ought to be attached and arrested, by reason of any
 corruption, afﬁnity, or indulgence, or for any other
 reason, let him be punished by imprisonment, at the
 discretion of the Warden and of the Aldermen, and
 according to the extent of the offence. And let the
 arms which they shall have for keeping the watch
 be provided and bought according to the ordinance of
 the Warden of the City, at the cost of the people of the
 Wards.

 And the King in especial doth will, that by these
 enactments neither the usages nor the enactments here-
 tofore followed in the City, in aid of keeping his peace,
 shall be abolished; such usages being reasonable and
 allowable according to law and reason, and not in
 contravention of these enactments. The King doth
 command that, for the maintaining of his peace, these
 Articles shall be well maintained and safely kept;
 or such other amendments as the King, at his will,
 shall make thereunto, according as he shall consider
 what is best to be done for the proﬁt of the City, when

 Of the place fo'r Weighing. Page 285.

 Whereas merchants do feel themselves aggrieved, by
 reason that the weight in the hostels and in the selds
 of citizen-merchants of London, by which they sell, do
 not agree with the weight by which they buy.—It is
 accorded, that the King shall have his weights in a
 certain place, or two places, or three, or four, if neces-
 sary, within the City ; and that all merchandize sold by
 weight that exceeds ﬁve-and-twenty pounds, shall be
 weighed with the King’s weights in weighing for the
 custom that pertains thereunto, according as shall be
 ordained. And unto such weights of the King as well
 buyers as sellers are to resort, after the form above
 stated.

 And if any person shall be found weighing merchan-
 dize, that is weighable, above the weight of ﬁve-and-
 twenty pounds, otherwise than by the King’s weights,
 and be attainted of the same, let the merchandize of
 such person be forfeited unto the King, in whatever
 hands the same shall be found ; and let the other party
 be heavily amerced unto the King. And let the
 weighers be sworn unto the King lawfully to weigh for

 . vendor and for buyer. And if the weigher shall be

 attainted of having weighed falsely, for or for pro-
 mise, for the one party or the other, let him be im-
 prisoned for a year and a day, if he cannot make
 restitution at the will of the King; nor shall he ever
 unto that office thereafter be re-admitted.

 And if it so happen that any servant or apprentice of

 where he is, let his master be answerable unto the
 said merchant for the value of the goods aforesaid, if the

 merchant can prove that such apprentice or servant
 was [living] with the said master when he took the
 merchant’s goods, and that the goods in his house, or
 elsewhere in his possession, have come unto the master
 aforesaid And this Ordinance is made, by reason
 that folks of the City sometimes, after such manner
 of goods so taken by their servants and by their
 apprentices, have been in the habit of discharging
 their apprentices and their servants and disavowing
 their acts, but have retained the goods; whereby the
 merchants have lost their goods without recovery.

 Feoﬁecs not trading shall pay Tallagc. Page 286.

 And when tallage shall be assessed upon the people
 of the City, let the tallage be assessed, as well upon
 landholders enfeoﬂ'ed who do not trade, as upon dealers
 who trade. And always, let consideration be had, that
 each person is assessed unto the tallage according as
 he is able [to pay]. And in a case of tallage which falls
 upon landholders enfeoﬂ‘ed, let only those lands and
 rents be comprised therein which they hold within
 the City, and not their tenements that are with-
 out. And the tenements of denizens are comprised
 in the tallage becausethe same are devisable, and
 therefore are property of a more certain nature than
 merchandize.

 That Mercha/nts owning towards the City shall not be
 molested. Page 287.

 And whereas merchants have been oftentimes molested
 by the bailiffs of the City, sometimes for eight days and
 more, so that they could not unload and harbour their
 goods and merchandize which they had brought by
 water, or place the same in safety—The King doth will
 and command, that from henceforth no one shall be
 molested in such manner that he cannot freely, on his

 whom the King, his city, and his territory may be
 proﬁted, shall come and wish to dwell in the City
 and enjoy the standing of the citizens of the city;
 and shall he testiﬁed to be a lawful merchant and
 of good repute, or as contributing in tallage and
 all other customs and charges, and to have well
 and lawfully behaved himself in his own [country],
 and well and lawfully to have departed therefrom;
 let such person be admitted to the standing of
 the citizens aforesaid, unto the like franchise, in such
 manner as the King shall have ordained for his own
 citizens in respect of buying and selling; as also, unto
 all customary ﬁ‘anchises; so nevertheless, that he shall
 be answerable with the citizens, according to his pro·
 portion, in the matter of tallages and all other things
 that unto the City pertain; and let him be in every
 way on an equal footing with them, as well in [bear-

 King doth will that the usages shall be maintained.
 And if judgment be matter of doubt, by reason whereof
 the judges have need of taking counsel—the which
 taking of counsel has heretofore been called ¹ ‘loque'ndw,’
 -—such time for taking counsel includes the space of
 two Hustings at most; that so at the third Hustings
 judgment shall be given without further delay. For of

 And a. joint Inquest, of denizens and foreigners, shall
 be made of twelve persons, the half of whom must be
 denizens and the other half foreigners dwelling in town,
 if the matter be contract of debt or trespass whereof
 foreign merchants may have knowledge.

 Of Vendors of Lands. Page 292.

 And whereas heretofore there was no remedy pro-
 vided in the City for warranty by those who are
 vendors of lands, when they have wholly sold all their
 lands, so that nothing remains unto them; by reason
 whereof the persons enfeoﬁ'ed, when they lvouch such
 [vendors], have no means of recovery, because such
 vendors have no [lands]. And yet, nevertheless, such
 vendors do trade upon the monies received for their
 lands so sold, and are rich in personalty.—It is
 [therefore] ordained and established, that the persons
 enfeoﬁ'ed, when they shall have need, shall 5’bave their
 voucher against those by whom they shall be enfeoﬁ'ed
 and who are resident in the City. And if such person
 does not appear at the ﬁrst summons, let the tenement
 for which he is vouchee be 3extended, at its exact
 value in the state in which it was, and of the goods
 of the vouchee let there be taken to the amount of
 such extent into the King’s hand, in place of ‘C'ape.

 And if he appears at the day given by the Cape,
 aﬁer his goods have been appraised, let the matter take
 such issue upon judgment given, and as to the goods
 so appraised, as it would have done in reference to

 that tenements in the City are equally as devisable as
 chatteLs. For which reason, the warranty ought in
 such case to fall as much upon chattels as upon tene-
 ments, seeing that the one and the other are [equally]
 lchattels: but so long as the vouchee shall have lands
 which may sufﬁce for the warranty, this Statute is
 not to be held to apply to chattels; nor is itto hold
 good against any one except against those who shall
 be residing in the City, and as to goods and chattels
 which they shall possess within the City, of which the
 Warden, by virtue of his jurisdiction, shall be able to
 make execution. And this enactment, as concerning
 chattels, shall hold good only as to the person of the
 vendor, and not as to his heirs; nor shall it hold good
 [as to them], if they have not land by descent at law.

 And whereas some persons in the City do let their

 such term do sell the same tenements to others than
 such termors, [to be held by them] in fee for ever;
 under colour of which feoﬂ'ment the feoﬁ'ees do eject
 the termors; for which ejectment no remedy has here-
 tofore been provided—The King doth will and com-
 mand, that from henceforth such persons ejected by
 feoﬂ'ees in manner aforesaid, upon plaint newly made
 unto the Warden, within forty days next after eject—

 in the same manner that they shall have the same at

 unto the Hastings in the same manner and upon the
 same issue that such pleas are brought in Bank by
 writ; seeing that the people of the City are traders,
 and have need of speedy remedy for grievances that
 are done unto them; and the Chancery is sometimes
 *fur away from them.

 And if the person to whom such wrong shall be
 done, shall surcease during the forty days aforesaid
 making plaint thereon, after the forty days in no
 manner may [redress] be made without the writ afore-
 said; provided always that such plea, [made] by writ
 and plaint, shall have the same issue. And by this
 enactment the writ of covenant is not to be annulled,
 so as no longer to hold good in its own proper case
 within the City.

 Of Debt aml Contract. Page 294-.

 In plea of debt and of contract, no record of a man

 Of a person waging he; law, his own hand the seventh.
 age 294.

 In plea of contract and of debt, when the party
 plaintiff has neither writing nor tally, the defendant
 may defend himself by [waging] his law. But in plea
 of trepass, as for bloodshed or for battery, the matter
 is determined by Inquest, unless it so be that the party
 plaintiff assents that the defendant shall clear himself
 by [waging] his law. And [in such case] the person is
 to make his law [with ¹ six compurgators], his own
 hand the seventh. And this order is to be observed
 as to all pleas that are pleaded in the City, as well
 with reference to denizens as to foreigners. And if it
 shall so happen that any one* unadvisedly makes wager
 of law in a case where Inquest lies,a [he is not there-
 fore to be adjudged as undefended, but is to be put
 by the Judge to the Inquest which so lies], without
 having other damage thereby. And no person is to
 be too lightly challenged in such manner of pleas for
 ³ miscounting or for [error in] making defence; provided
 only that he use such words as are requisite for trial
 to be made of the whole [matter in dispute].

 That no poor man shall be challenged because he does
 not use the words in C(m'rt due according to law.

 ment ; save only ﬁnes and amercements, and such

 things as, according to ancient usage, are reasonable
 and admissible by law.

 That a Court for leitgners shall be holden daily,

 And whereas the King doth will that no foreign
 merchant shall be delayed by a long series of plead-
 ings, the King doth command that the Warden or
 Sheriffs shall bear daily the pleas of such foreigners
 as shall Wish to make plaint, or cases in which others
 shall wish to make plaint against foreigners; and that
 speedy redress be given unto them. And if the War-
 den or Sheriff upon any day shall be unable [to act],
 then let there be some one in their stead to do the
 same, for whom they shall be ready to answer: that
 so the foreign merchants be in no manner delayed.

 But in especial he doth will, that of all pleas that

 In Pleas of the Crown, where a citizen or other man
 of the franchise of the City of London, for felony by
 the death of a man caused within the City, is in-
 dicted upon Inquest taken before the Coroner, and
 put in prison; and according to usage heretofore was
 wont to be bailed from prison by twelve reputable
 men, [ready] to have his body before the Justiciars
 Itinerant at the Tower, when they should come thither,
 -It is provided, that from henceforth, a person so im-
 prisoned shall be bailed by such twelve reputable men,
 who shall give security for him to have his body
 before the J usticiars Itinerant at the Tower, when they
 shall come thither, or before such other Justices as the
 King shall think proper to assign, to hear and deter-
 mine in such case.

 And whereas many persons imprisoned heretofore
 have died before the coming of the Justiciars Itinerant
 to the Tower, by reason whereof the felonies in such
 cases were not, and could not be, proved or punished.2
 And when the King shall assign Justiciars so to act

 out of the Iter, then are such Justiciars to give notice
 unto the Sheriff's by their Writ to cause the persons
 out on bail to be warned, Wheresoever they may be, and
 also the bailors to be warned to have the persons so
 bailed before them on a certain day; which day, from
 the time of warning, is to embrace the space of four
 months. And upon the day on which the J usticiam so
 assigned shall come, they shall proceed with such matter
 in the same way and upon the same issues as was the
 usage before the Justiciars Itinerant at the Tower.
 And be it made known, that this manner of law ought
 to be observed as against those accused of homicide,
 such accused being of the City and of the franchise of
 London. And if a foreigner, or strange man, shall be
 challenged with having done such thing in the City,
 proceedings must be taken according to the Common
 Law.

 “ with the assent of the Commons, to the honour of

 “ dained and established that no one of the said city,
 “ nor any other person whatever, as well of foreign
 “ lands as of this land, shall be so daring from hence-

 “ any other person whatever, shall be attainted from
 “ henceforth of having made and accomplished any
 “ such bargain, and the person upon whom the loss
 “ has fallen shall think proper to make complaint
 “ unto the Mayor for the time being, within forty
 “ days after his day of payment, the said Mayor shall
 “ forthwith cause distraint to be made upon him
 “ who shall be impeached thereof, as well by his
 “ body as by all his goods; and that when he shall

 “ have been attainted, he shall be kept in prison, with· ·

 “ and know false and deceitful exchange from that
 “ which is good and allowable, and also harmful con-

 “ be chosen two Aldermen and four Commoners of
 “ good repute and good discretion, and guiltless of

 “ therein. The which well and lawfully to accom-

 “ parties in such a case, or of promise before made
 “ between them by covin, such person shall forswear

 “ times the sum which he shall have so received, or
 “ which he may think to have by reason of promise
 “ before made.”

 “Edward, by the grace of God, King of England,
 “ Lord of Ireland and of Acquitaine, to the Mayor and
 . “ Sheriﬂ‘s of London, greeting. We are continually
 “ pressed by divers complaints of the great and of the
 “ commons of our realm, for that many merchants and
 “ others, dwelling in our city of London, colourably
 “ and subtly have made, and do make from day to day,
 “ divers exchanges of money and of other things that
 “ do not concern the dealings of lawful merchandize; 1220.8,
 “ whereby very great damage has accrued unto our-
 “ selves and to our people, and more will accrue (which
 “ may God forbid) if remedy be not applied thereto.
 “ We do therefore command and charge you, upon the
 “ fealty and allegiance which unto us you owe, that
 “ in all best manners and ways that you lmow of or
 “ may, you do cause diligently, and from time to time,
 “ enquiry to be made as to such exchanges, and as to
 “ the persons who have made [the same], and who shall
 “ from henceforth make the like, be they Lombards,
 “ French, English, or of any other nation or condition
 “ whatsoever; as also, for whom and for what cause,
 “ how and in what manner, and in regard to what
 “ town, country, or place, such exchanges have been
 “ effected or shall hereafter be effected; and that,
 “ in so far as you may ﬁnd thereon by such Inquisi-
 “ tions or by other credible information, you do certify
 “ successively ourselves and our Council thereon, with-
 “ out shewing remissness or favour in such case in
 “ behalf of any person whomsoever: to the end that
 “ such amendment and remedy may be applied thereto
 “ in fact as has been heretofore ordained thereon; and
 “ that our said people may have neither matter nor
 “ cause for making complaint unto us for the same
 “ reason. And further, you are to cause to be called

 “ fraud may be committed therein by means of any
 “ exchanges or exchangers whatsoever, against the effect
 “ or intention of our present command; as we do

 It is also provided and commanded, that from hence-

 partners, shall so ordain that their baskets, in which
 they bring their ﬁsh from the sea, be more convenient
 and of larger size; and that from henceforth each
 basket contain in itself but one manner of ﬁsh. And
 that no one of the ﬁshmongers aforesaid, or of their
 partners, be so daring as falsely to 2dub their baskets;
 that is to say, to make a show at the top of the
 basket of desirable ﬁsh, and beneath, in the baskets,
 to, put undesirable ﬁsh of little value. And if any
 person be attainted of so doing, such ﬁsh is to be
 forfeited, and the dubber to be imprisoned; and
 from thenceforth let him be held as a cheat. And this

 Whereas for some time the reputable men of the trade
 of ﬁshmongers of London had a certain form, whereby
 they were boundto buy and sell their ﬁsh in certain
 places and within certain boundaries, according to
 certain points and certain Articles, which are found in
 the remembrances of the City ; the which points used to
 be read in the two 3 Laghalmotes which the reputable
 men hold in presence of the Sheriff's each year; but
 through frequent removal of the Sheriff's and the Bailiﬁ's,
 [and] through too great suﬂ'erance on part of some»
 of the Bailiﬂ's, the said Articles are not duly observed
 and are abused; by reason whereof it is proper’ to
 apply a remedy thereto—In the time of King Edward,
 son of King Henry, in the eighth year of his reign,

 don, with the reputable men, Aldermen of the City,
 having heard and understood the reasons of the re-
 putable men of that trade, in the way of. certain
 amendments to the Articles aforesaid, which the [said]
 reputable men delivered for the common proﬁt of the
 City and of all [other] folks and to the end that
 from henceforth there may be no doubting, but cer-
 tainty, as to how the folks of the trade ought to
 comport themselves, have established and assented in
 such manner as in this book is underwritten.—

 No man of the City, or other person, is to sell or

 that the reputable men of the trade may sell their
 own salt ﬁsh, in which no 3foreigner has a share,

 No person is to buy ﬁsh in any vessel before the

 But the strangers [themselves] must come and sell
 their ﬁsh, and must do their best, if one half of the
 2ﬁsh is not theirs, for gain or for loss. And as to
 this the strange partner is to make oath [if he

 the owner does not come; and if there be great
 suspicion as to the same, the partner that is free of

 Of Oysters and Whel/cs. Page 381.

 And as to oysters, and whelks, and mussels, that
 come to the City, that no one shall sell them, or avow
 them, but only those who ﬁsh them and bring them;
 nor ’yet any other ﬁsh that folks [usually] bring as of
 their own ﬁshing. And that the King shall have as
 his custom from the boat that brings ﬁve tandels of
 whelks, one tandel ; to whatever person and persons the
 whelks belong, whether more or less. And that neither
 oysters, whelks, nor mussels shall lie for sale beyond
 two ebbs and a ﬂood. Nor shall any boatload be sold
 in gross, save that, when the stranger shall not have
 sold all by noon, resellers may buy the remainder and
 put the same in their shops and sell it, and not in
 the boat.

 . Nor shall any stranger [buy] of a stranger. And

 the reputable men of the trade who have their boats
 and their own nets, are to sell their ﬁsh as they were
 wont; and strangers are to sell their own ﬁsh that
 they bring, without avowry of the ﬁsh, at the best
 [price] they may.

 And that all manner of ﬁsh that comes into the City
 and is enclosed in baskets, must be as good below as

 basket, that so it is. And he who shall sell other-
 wise, is to lose the ﬁsh.

 And as to sturgeon that comes in barrels, that it
 must all be of one taking and of one salting.

 And as to each manner of ﬁsh that comes into the
 City at night, it is not to be removed from the boat
 before the hour of sunrise aforesaid, whether belonging,
 that is -to say, to foreigner or to denizen; supposing
 that it be not in rainy weather that it comes at night.
 And in such case, it must lie upon the quay of the
 City in keeping of the serjeant of the street, until
 the hour aforesaid.

 And that no manner of ﬁsh that comes by land in
 baskets shall be harboured in shops or in house; but
 [the dealers lare to sell the same before their shops in
 view of the people: save as to the reputable men of the
 trade, who may harbour their own ﬁsh upon view of

 posing of anything, they fully [bring] the same to

 And that from henceforth no one shall take more
 than two or three apprentices at most, and that
 only according as he is of ability to support them; or
 [shall take] any apprentice for a less term than seven
 years, and such term to be completed; and that, by
 view of four reputable men of the trade, in such man-
 ner that the master and the apprentice, while he is
 working at the trade, come to the Guildhall, and cause
 the covenant and the term to be enrolled; and also do
 the same at the end of the term, if the death of the
 one or the other does not dissolve [the apprenticeship].

 Also, that n apprentice shall commence dealing, and
 no man 81]εῇ commit *forecheap against another in
 dealing hereafter. But the reputable men of the trade
 are to make their purchases, from henceforth, in a fair
 manner, without injury done to any other person, and
 without forecheap. And that neither for anger nor for
 spite, shall any vendor hold his ﬁsh too dear; and if
 vendors do so, the Mayor and reputable men shall
 assign proper persons to assess the same.

 As concerning those who are now apprentices, that
 no one shall work after Sunday [next], until such time
 as his master and he shall have come to the Guildhall,
 and have caused to be enrolled their covenant and
 the term.

 As concerning the Abbot of Saint Alban’s, good
 care must be taken that his buyers buy nothing to
 be taken out of the City, except for the use of the
 Abbot and Convent of the house only.

 No man from henceforth is to buy herrings, mae-
 kerel, or other ﬁsh that comes to the City by cart,
 before the hour of noon, for resale.

 Sprats are [to be] sold and measured by tandel

 Ralph Oomwaille presented unto the Mayor and
 Aldermen a. certain bill, in these words :—

 “Very honourable Sirs, Mayor, Aldermen, and Com—
 “ mons of London, by way of plaint touching the
 “ horrible vice of usury assigned, sheweth unto you
 “ Ralph Cornwaille,—that shortly before the Feast of
 " Saint Michael, in the nine-and-fortieth year of our
 “ Lord the King now reigning, in the Parish of Saint
 “ Bartholomew the Little in the Ward of 1Brad-
 “ stret, he came unto John de Saint Mariemount and
 “ Aldebrande Gascoigne, a Lombard, correctors, pray-
 “ ing them to render him aid, in the way of lending
 “ twelve pounds until a certain day upon suﬁcient
 “ surety, [he] promising them a sufﬁcient reward for
 “ their trouble. And they agreed so to do ; whereupon
 “ the selﬁsame correctors went unto Walter Southous on
 “ the same business, and caused to be made an obliga-
 “ tion in double the said amount unto the said Walter
 “ Southous; in the which the said Ralph and John
 “ Tettesbury, skinner, were bound jointly and severally
 “ in the whole.

 “ And then the said Ralph, expecting to have the said
 “ sum of twelve pounds, comprised in the said writing,
 “ came unto the said Walter Southcus, and the said
 “ John Tettesbury with him, to receive the said payment
 “ of the twelve pounds, comprised in the said writing,
 . “ for the use of the said Ralph, and to seal the said
 “ writing. At which time the said John de Saint Mar-ye-
 “ mount and Aldebrande delivered unto the said Ralph
 “ in the name of the said Walter Southous ten pounds
 “ in gold, and no more ; and said that he could not, and

 “ ought not to, have any more at that time ; ,where-
 “ fore the said Ralph received the ten pounds in gold,
 “ and the said Ralph and John Tettesbury sealed the
 “ said obligation as to twelve pounds, made in double
 “ [that amount], by way of surety for the ten pounds
 “ aforesaid, to be paid on the arrival of the day ap-
 “ pointed.

 “ And on the day for payment, came the said Ralph
 " unto the said Walter, bringing his payment of ten
 “ pounds and demanding the obligation; and the said
 “ Walter made answer to him that this he would not
 “ do, without he were paid twelve pounds. And because
 “ the said Ralph would not pay him forty shillings
 " more than his debt amounted to, the said Walter
 “ sued him in the Court of one of the Sheriffs of
 “ London, to the wrong and great damage of the said

 “Wherefore, very honourable Sirs, forasmuch as you
 “ are ordained to take judicial cognizance of offences
 “ in such cases [committed], may it please you, for
 ' “ the love of God, to cause all the parties before-men-
 “ tioned to appear before you; and to examine this
 “ matter and the answer made thereunto, for making
 “ known the truth thereon, that so the horrible sin
 “ of usury by such evil contrivance may not have its
 “ course.”

 “ and might sell the same unto the citizens, and not

 “ And now for some time the merchants of the said

 good folks of the Ward some men as common whore-
 mongers, common adulterers, and common bawds; as
 also, women, as common courtesans, common adul-

 of removing them out of the City, or for making
 them cease so to offend, to the pleasing of God, the
 salvation of their souls, and the cleanness and honesty
 of the said city; of whom no correction has heretofore
 been made, because that no Ordinance thereupon has
 been made, but rather, they have been suffered and
 allowed, to the great displeasing of God and to the
 dishonour of the City :—It is ordained and agreed by
 the Mayor, and Aldermen, and Common Council, of.
 the said City, that from henceforth each Alderman,
 forthwith alter his Wardmote held, and the verdict
 unto him returned, shall, if any such of evil and

 be taken and carried to prison, there to remain until
 they shall be cleared by Inquisition, or confronted U].

 [Of the Electim of the C’mnmon Council by the

 “ By reason that complaint has been made by many
 “ good folks of the town unto the Mayor, that now
 “ is, how that divers times in the Council wont [to
 “ meet] within the Hall and Chambers of the Guildhall,
 “ great tumult and peril have been perceived, both by
 “ reason of the great assemblages there, and too often
 “ by reason of the insufﬁcient persons deputed unto
 “ the said Councils, as oftentimes seen in the judg-
 “ ments of the said Councils, [supported] more by cla-
 “ mour than by reason; to the great disturbance of
 “ peace and quiet among the people in time past, and
 “ still more likely in time to come, if some remedy
 “ be not provided against the same. Upon which, the
 “ Mayor, with his Aldermen and the good Commons,
 “ did choose certain persons, with deliberation to ad-
 “ vise thereupon how such tumult and peril might best
 “ be avoided and remedied; the which persons, meet-
 “ ing together upon divers days on the matter aforesaid,
 “ have, by way of remedy for such perils, upon con-
 “ sideration ordained the Articles after-written ,—
 “ should it be pleasing unto the Mayor and to the other
 “ good folks of the City for a time to make trial of
 “ the same; to the intent that if welfare and peace
 “ be found in such counsels through the Ordinances
 “ aner-written, the same in the name of God may be
 “ conﬁrmed. And if the contrary, which may God
 “ not will, that the same may in due time be amended,
 “ for the common good of all the City.

 “ First, in order to continue the Common Council of
 “ the City by persons sufﬁcient, as well in means as in
 “ understanding, be it ordained, that each year after the
 " Day of Saint Gregory [12 March], when the Aldermen
 “ shall have been appointed, the Aldermen appointed

 “ making omission for no ofﬁce that they have held
 “ before, to be of the Common Council for the year
 “ ensuing, and to present the names of the said four
 “ unto the Mayor for the time being; the which persons
 “ shall be accepted by the Mayor, and ordered to take
 “ their oath, as has been set forth by writing here-

 " Provided always, that the Mayor for the time being
 “ shall not receive throughout the whole town from any
 “ trade, for the Common Council, beyond eight persons
 “ of such one trade, and no more ; even though it should
 “ happen that more than eight persons of one trade
 “ have been presented and elected; in which case, as
 “ to the Mayor, by the advice of six Aldermen, there
 “ shall be accepted eight persons of the most auﬂi-
 “- cient, and the others returned to their Ward, that
 “ other sufﬁcient persons may be chosen in their place,
 “ who are not of the like trade.

 “ And by reason that in some Wards in the City
 “ there may not always be found four persons, of auﬂi-

 “ that as to the Wards which are large and of sufﬁcient

 Of awarding Damages in Dower. Page 470.

 Whereas women have heretofore been long and tor-
 tiously delayed in gaining their dower of tenements and
 rents of which their husbands have died seised, by
 reason that no damages were awarded in such case ;—
 it is agreed, that from henceforth they shall recover
 their damages for dower, in such manner from them
 withheld, regard had to the value of the tene-
 ments and rents, [and] to the length of the suit which
 they shall have made.

 Of Damages 'i/n a Plea of Debt. Page 47].

 Item, that all folks shall recover their damages for
 debts from them withheld, if the debtors do not make
 acknowledgment, at their ﬁrst Court when they shall be
 summoned thereunto, without any delay; that is to say,
 for twenty withheld for one year four
 and for more more, and for less less, according to the
 amount and the time that the debt shall have been
 withheld. And let there be execution immediately after
 acknowledgment made, unless the demandant give a
 [further] day of his own free will. And as to the goods
 and chattels that shall be taken for debts so acknow-
 ledged, let them be appraised at the next Sheriff’s Court,
 and the day after delivered unto the ‘debtor, if he who
 shall have made the acknowledgment is not willing to
 redeem them. And in case the appraisers shall have
 wrongly appraised them, and he to whom the debt is
 due is not willing to receive them at the price, let
 them be delivered unto the appraisers, and from their
 own goods and chattels let the price be levied.

 As to plaints now pending in the Sheriﬁ's' Court,
 if the debtors make acknowledgment at the next
 Court after that at which this regulation is read and

 notiﬁed in the Court where such plaint is pending, let
 such debtors be absolved from damages; and if not,
 let damages in such plaints be awarded, as is before
 mentioned.

 Emirw of the King's Service. Page 47l.

 Item, that no essoin of the King’s Service shall be
 allowed in the Sheriﬂ's’ Court for the defendant, ex-
 cept in a case where he shall have pleaded to the
 country, either to make his law or to bring his suit
 to a hearing. And then, if he have not his warranty
 at the day which he shall have by essoin, let it be
 adjudged as the law of the City demands.

 Of the eam. Page 472.

 Item, in case of a person who shall have waged his
 law and afterwards makes default in making his law,
 let judgment be forthwith given upon the principal, and
 still, let him not be summoned to hear his judgment;
 forasmuch as such summons would be against law and
 reason, in delaying the [other] party from his recovery
 without reasonable cause.

 Of Assizea as to Rent. Page 472.

 Item, in a plea of seizure of distresses for rent-service
 or rent—charge, after return irreplevisable awarded in
 the Hustings, if the tenant shall then appear to coun-
 terplead the rent and not to pay it, it shall be fully
 lawful for him who demands the rent, to prosecute his
 suit by plaint of Novel Disseisin. And in the same
 manner be it done, if any one shall make denial or rescue,
 so that entry cannot be had for distraint. And in such
 case, let the Assize be in the ﬁrst place charged upon
 the same points. And if it be found that the tenant

 has duly made rescue or hindrance unto the entry for
 distress, let the Assize be taken according to the plea
 which shall be pleaded between the parties. And if
 the contrary be found, let the plaintiff take nothing
 by Assize, but let them plead in the Hustings, as is
 before mentioned.

 And nevertheless, be it fully lawful for him who
 demands rent to plead in the Hustings for the rent,
 if he will.

 Of taking Inquisitiom. Page 4-72.

 Item, for expediting the right of all persons, so far
 as with law and reason may be done, and especially as
 to Inquisitions to be taken at the Hustings,—-which are
 too much delayed through default of the jurors,—-let
 them be entered in the R011, and command given unto
 the Sheriff's to distrain them to be present at the next
 Hustings, as has oftentimes been done heretofore. And
 nevertheless, let the Aldermen, by their bedel, so far as
 they shall see ﬁt to do, make return of their Wards
 at each Hustings.

 That the Qﬁicers shall make the oath yearly. Page 473.

 Item, that all ofﬁcers of the City, clerks, serjeants,
 bailiffs, the person who shall be appointed by the She-
 riﬂ's to be their lieutenant in the County of Middlesex,
 clerks and bailiffs under him, lfermors, warders of
 prisons, bedels of Wards, and grooms who are assigned
 for taking cartage or doing other duties, shall be sworn
 each year before the Mayor and Aldermen, aﬂ’er the
 Sheriffs shall have made oath, each according to that
 which pertains unto the position which he holds.

 Item, that the pleaders who are commonly residing
 in the City for pleading, shall be sworn that they will
 not plead, or give counsel, against the usages and
 franchises of the City of London; but that they will
 maintain the same to the best of their power, within
 the City and without.

 Item, that the attorneys shall be sworn in the same
 manner. And further, that they will not answer as
 attorney for any one, if they are not received and set
 forth on the R011; and that they will consult their
 mmembrances and make suit unto the Common Clerk
 of the City, that their pleas in the Hustings, touch-
 ing their employers, may be well and properly entered
 without any manner of tardiness; and that well and
 lawfully they will prosecute the business of their
 clients, without committing fraud or deception upon
 the Court or upon them.

 Of the Record at I;,S'a,i/n.t ‚fla'rtin’s le Grafnd.

 Item, whereas many folks in the City have here-
 tofore oﬁentimes sued writs to have record and pro-
 cess brought before the Justiciars at Saint Martin’s le
 Grand, who are persons of the Common Law and
 cannot have full cognizance of the franchises and
 usages of the City; whereby the said franchises and
 usages have oftentimes been brought into great ques-
 tion and great peril, and the Mayor, Aldermen,
 Sheriﬂ's, and Commons, to great trouble and costs :—
 It is agreed, that no person shall sue such manner
 of writs, before he shall have shown his grievances
 unto the Mayor and Aldermen, and the matters shall
 by them have been examined.

 And if there be any misprision therein, [let the same
 be] redressed by them, if they can do so ; and if they

 for the labour and costs that the Mayor, Aldermen,
 ofﬁcers, and commons, have been put to by his suit;
 if somuch as that can be found from his goods and
 chattels.

 Of the same. Page 474-.

 Item, in process of Pleas of Debts, Covenants, and
 other Pleas, in which the party ought to be brought
 [before the Court] by summons and by essoin, if he
 be willing, and aﬁaer that by distress; let it be done
 according to the usages of the City that have been
 followed from of old; that is to say, alter summons,
 one essoin. If the party makes default, let a distress be
 awarded of his goods and chattels in place of attach-
 ment; or else, as to the two pledges found for his
 appearance at the next Court, let the mainpernors
 be amerced. And then let it be awarded, that he be
 distrained by all his goods and chattels, and by at-
 tachment of rents; and this from day to day, with-
 out him having any indulgence, or ﬁnding any main-
 pnse.

 Of producing Witnesses. Page 4-75.

 Item, that if any one shall vouch two witnesses to
 bar a man of his law, or of Inquest, the same shall
 not be received unless they be folks of good re-
 port, and not common suitors or approvers before the
 Ordinaries at Saint Paul’s or elsewhere, or persons
 suspected of evil. And if the [other] party shall wish
 to challenge the same, let him come before the Mayor
 and Aldermen; and there let the persons be examined
 and their conditions be testiﬁed unto; and alter that,
 let there be done unto the parties that which reason
 demands.

 Item, that the statute of Smythfeld shall be ob-

 gets.

 Of keeping the Peace. Page 475.

 Item, the better to preserve the peace of our Lord
 the King, and that each may fear the more to break
 his peace, it is ordained, that if any person shall
 draw a sword, misericorde, or knife, or any arm, even
 though he do not strike, he shall pay unto the City
 half a mark, or remain in the prison of Newgate
 for ﬁfteen days. And if he draw blood of any one,
 let him pay unto the [City] twenty shillings, or
 remain in the said prison forty days. And if he
 strike any one with the ﬁst, even though he have
 not drawn blood, let him pay unto the City two
 shillings, or be imprisoned eight days. And if he
 draw blood with the ﬁst, let him pay unto the City
 forty pence, or be imprisoned for twelve days. And
 let such offenders ﬁnd good surety before their release,
 and for their good behaviour; and nevertheless, let
 him upon whom the offence has been committed, have
 his recovery by process of law.

 And let such offences of bloodshed, against the peace
 of our Lord the King, he pleaded from day to day
 before the Sheriffs, without having any essoin or other
 delay, [in manner] most convenient, of whatever con-
 dition the party may be.

 Of Hostele-rs. Page 476.

 Item, whereas heretofore it has been ordained, for
 the preservation of the peace, that no man should
 harbour another beyond a day and a night, if he should
 not wish to make answer for him, in case he should

 oﬂ'end; as to which no penalty was ordained, and
 no punishment inﬂicted; and therefore this Ordinance
 was by no one at all regarded :—It is ordained, that
 no one shall harbour or maintain any man or woman
 who is of bad repute, or notoriously suspected of bad
 conduct, or who shall have so behaved, under pain of
 paying forty shillings unto the community, if he be
 attainted thereof.

 Of the Watmowse of the 17mm. Page 476.

 Item, whereas the watercourse of the Thames which
 is wholly pertaining unto the City, is greatly impeded
 by the purpresture of quays and other encroachments
 made in the said water, to the great damage and peril
 of all the City; and also, for the avoiding of greater
 perils and damages in time to come :-—It is ordained
 by the Mayor and Aldermen, with the assent of the
 Commons, that from henceforth no purpresture shall
 be made by the erection of quays, or in any other
 manner, upon the water of Thames, without view of
 the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons; and by them
 be it adjudged, whether no peril or damage will
 irom such purpresture unto the City ensue.

 Item, that no hoard, or palings, or other enclosure,

 prejudicial, the same are to be in no manner allowed

 And in the like manner let it be done as to steps

 behaviour of the ofﬁcers, bailiffs, fermors, gaoler, ser-
 jeants of Wards, and others, who hold ofﬁce in the
 City; that so it may be, that no other persons may
 intermeddle therewith, upon default of the Mayor, to
 the prejudice of the franchise of the City.

 Item, it is ordained that all the mysteries of the City
 of London shall be lawfully regulated and governed,
 each according to its nature, in due manner; that so no

 of the good folks of the said mysteries, and for the
 common proﬁt of the people. And in each mystery
 let there be chosen and sworn four, or six, or more
 or less, according as the mystery shall need; which
 persons, so chosen and sworn, shall have full power
 from the Mayor well and lawfully to do and perform
 the same.

 And if any person of the said mysteries shall be
 rebellious, contradictory, or fractious, that so such per-

 Of Tenants for term of Life or »im Tail. Page 495.

 Whereas heretofore it has oftentimes happened that
 where many good folks of the City of London have
 devised their lands, rents, and tenements, unto their

 wives for term of life, or to others for term of life or
 in fee tail, and, aﬁer their decease, the remainder of the
 said lands, rents, and tenements, to their children, or to
 others, for term of life, or in fee tail, or in fee simple.
 And in cases where the reversion was reserved after the
 death of the tenant for term of life, or after the estate
 tail determined, the [said remainder-men] were to have
 the said estates: others who had only for term of life or
 in fee tail, the lands, and rents, and tenements, so devised
 to them, have alienated the same in fee unto strange
 persons and others, with clause of warranty, to the
 disherison of the children and others unto whom the
 remainder was belonging, contrary to the will of the
 testator.—It is therefore ordained, by common assent
 of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons, thereunto sum-
 moned, that no person from henceforth, who shall
 demand any lands, or tenements, or rents, in the City

 of London, or in the suburbs thereof, by force of any.

 shall, in the case aforesaid, be barred by any deed con-
 taining warranty of any such who have no estate
 [therein] except for term of life or in fee tail, even
 though such person be heir unto any one of them;
 unless he hold by descent-in fee simple, so as to be

 In the Statute made at Westminster, the Monday
 next aher the Feast of Saint [13 January], in
 the thirteenth year of the reign of King Richard, the
 Second [of that name] since the Conquest, the Statute
 of Westminster, the Second, above-written, was con-
 ﬁrmed, adding thereto, that salmon-fry was not to be
 taken throughout the said time at the stanks of mills,
 or elsewhere, under the same penalty: and that no
 ﬁsherman or garthman, or other person, of whatever
 estate or condition he might be, should place from thence—
 forth in the waters of Thames, Humber, Ouse, Trent, or
 in any other water of the realm, throughout the said

 “ stalkers,” or other nets or engines whatsoever, where-
 by the fly or brood of salmon, lampreys, or any other
 ﬁsh whatsoever, might in any manner be taken or

 And also, whereas it is contained in the same Statute,
 that all the waters in which salmon are taken through-
 out the kingdom shall be placed in fence as to the
 taking of salmon, from the Day of the Nativity of Our
 Lady [8 September], until the Day of Saint Martin
 [11 November]; it is ordained and agreed, that the

 cient Conservators of the said Statute of Westminster,
 that they may [punish] offenders according to the pe-

 made in the thirteenth year of his reign, above speciﬁed,
 was duly executed, for default of good Conservators,
 as the said King Richard had understood by plaint
 unto him in the said Parliament, in his seventeenth
 year, made: in such Parliament it was accorded and
 agreed, that the Justices of the peace in all the Counties
 of England should be Conservators of the said Statutes
 in the Counties in which they should be Justices.
 And that they, and every of them, at all times when
 they could attend thereto, should examine the mispri-
 sions and the defaults attempted contrary to the Statutes
 aforesaid, and also should survey and search all gorces
 in such rivers, that the same were not too narrow, to
 the destruction of such fry and brood, but of reasonable
 opening according to the ancient Assize.

 At the Parliament holden at Westminster, in the one-

 “ Whereas by the Lord Edward, late of England,

 “ England was oftentimes impeded by the of

 Be it remembered, that on the nineteenth day of
 February, in the seventh year of the reign of our
 Lord King Henry, since the Conquest the Fourth [of
 that name], the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty
 of the City of London appeared here, before the Council
 of our said Lord the King, at Westminster, and here
 delivered unto view their Petition, shewing thereby
 how that they, and their prodeeemors, from time as to

 by reason of divers liberties, franchises, and customs,
 and also by Charters of the progenitors of our said
 Lord the King unto them granted, and by the same our
 Lord the conﬁrmed, and by divers Statutes made,
 the conservancy and correction of all lddels, trinks,
 nets, and other engines whatsoever, in the waters of
 Thames and Medeway laid, whereby the ﬁsh in the
 said waters spawned, when not seasonable, might be

 taken and destroyed, against the Statutes thereon made ;
 and also, to place under them sub-conservators in the
 said waters of the Statutes and franchises aforesaid

 And that whereas one Alexander Boner, sub-conser-
 vator of the said Statutes in the said waters, by the
 aforesaid Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, deputed
 and sworn, on the ninth day of the said month of
 February, while performing his duties in the waters
 aforesaid, did ﬁnd sixteen nets, which he took; and
 would have carried them to London, there to be ex-
 amined and adjudged upon before the said Mayor,
 Aldermen, and Commonalty, as to whether the same
 were of reasonable mesh or not; there came thither, on
 that same day, John Sampsone, Benet Lorkyn, William
 Serle, Thomas Rokesle, Benet Kent, John Caude, John
 Hook, William Segood, Thomas Coole, William Bur-
 deux, John Merdene, John Scot, John Littelman, John
 Man, Nicholas Haytone,—of Erehithe ; John Trymcok,
 Thomas Pesog, —- of Prattysferye; Henry Prakylle,
 William Olyve, Thomas Squyrelle, John Prakille,-—of
 Berkyng; Ralph Trymcok, John Man, John Rabelle,
 John Martyn, Stephen Hogge, John Rydelle, and Ralph
 'J‘ot,——of Wulwiche, and many others of the Counties
 of Essexe and of Kent, to the number of two thou-
 sand persons, horribly, by sound raised of the bells of
 the churches upon the shores of the said waters stand-
 ing, and in guise of insurrection, as persons who would
 not be ruled according to the law of our said Lord
 the King, against his crown and dignity arrayed to
 make war, with bows, arrows, and swords, bucklers,
 clubs, [and] doors and windows in place of shields;
 and upon the said Alexander did make assault, and
 a great number of arrows at him on the said water
 of Thames discharge, [and] did in divers boats ﬁlled
 with men in arms him to the town of Berkyng
 pursue.

 At the which town the said Alexander landed, and
 there delivered unto the constables of the said town of

 Berkyng, in presence of Thomas Shepey and Stephen
 Ingelfelde, the sixteen nets aforesaid, until the Mayor
 should cause the said nets to be sent for, to examine
 them and adjudge thereon, as before is stated.

 Upon which day, came the said folks of Erehithe,
 Prattisferie, Berkyng, and Wolewiche, before-named,
 unto the said town of Berkyng, and did take the said
 nets fmﬁ. the custody of the said constables, wrongfully
 and against the Statutes, in contempt of our said
 Lord the King, and against the liberties and franchises
 of the said city; wherefore the aforesaid Mayor, and
 Aldermen, and" Commonalty did pray the said Council
 to provide due remedy therefor. Whereupon, ,by
 the same Council command was given unto Simon
 Blakborne, one of the Serjeants-ab-arms of our said
 Lord the King, to cause to be arrested the said
 John Sampsone and his accomplices before-named, and
 to bring thorn before the said Council, to make answer
 unto the matters above stated.

 By force of which command, the Serjeant—at—arms
 aforesaid arrested as many of the said persons as he
 could ﬁnd, and brought them before the said Council
 at Westminster, on the one-and-twentieth day of the
 said month of February; that is to say, John Samp-
 sone, Benet Lorkyn, John Caude, William Segood,
 Thomas Cole, John Merden, Nicholas Haytone, [of
 Erehithe]; John Trymcok, Thomas Pesog, of Prat-
 tisferie; Henry Prakylle, William Olyve, Thomas
 Squyrelle, and John Martyn, above-written.

 Which day being now arrived, because that all the
 Lords of the said Council, by reason of certain very
 weighty business that demanded their attention, greatly
 touching the estate of our said Lord the King and
 of his realm, could not ﬁnd time or attend unto the
 examination of the matter aforesaid ; such examination
 was committed, by authority of the said Council, unto
 Messires the Duke of York, and the Lords de Roos

 and de Burnelle; the which, by virtue of such
 authority, did duly examine the said matter. Upon
 which examination, the said John Sampsone, Benet
 Lorkyn, and the others, their accomplices, so arrested
 and brought before the said Council, were found guilty
 in this behalf, as well towards our said Lord the
 King, as towards the Mayor, Aldermen, [and] Com-
 monalty aforesaid. And upon such report being made
 thereon unto Messires the Archbishop of Canterbury,
 the Bishops of Winchester, of Durham, and of Bath, and
 to the other Lords of the said Council, by the Duke and
 Lords aforesaid, the above-named John Sampsone and
 his said companions did submit themselves unto the
 mercy and grace of our said Lord the King, for
 that they had in this case offended against him;
 humbly entreating the said Mayor, Aldermen, and
 Commonalty, to pardon them their trespasses and
 offences, so against them in this behalf done and per-
 petrated; [and] promising lawfully and in good faith
 to abstain from thenceforth from naming or attempting
 any such things, or the like.

 . The which Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, from
 reverence for the said Archbishop of Canterbury and
 the said other Lords, benignly hearkening unto the
 said supplication, did pardon the said transgression;
 their trespasses and offences aforesaid; and further, by
 mediation of the said Lords, did grant and give
 licence unto the possessors of the sixteen nets afore-
 said, to ﬁsh with those nets until the Feast of Easter
 then next ensuing.

 Whereupon, by the said Lords of Council it was
 awarded, that the said sixteen nets should be brought
 and delivered unto the said Mayor of London the
 Sunday then next ensuing, to the intent that the same
 Mayor, by his own hands, might restore or deliver
 them unto the possessors thereof, to take ﬁsh therewith,
 at their pleasure, until the said Feast of Easter, in

 manner as above stated—Provided always, that be-
 tween then and the same Feast, they should cause new
 nets to be made, according to the standard of London;
 and that at such Feast of Easter, they should cause to
 be brought unto the said Mayor, as well the said
 old nets, to be burnt in case they should be found
 defective, as the said new nets, to be by the same
 Mayor proved, examined, and sealed, as pertains there-
 unto. And provided also, that they should not put in
 use such new nets, or any other new nets, ﬁ‘om thence-
 forth, until the same should have been ﬁrst presented
 unto the Mayor of London for the time being, and
 by him proved, examined, and sealed, according to the
 form and effect of the Statutes aforesaid.

 the origin of the word ‘ aﬁ'eer,’
 see Wedgwood’s Dict. Engl. Ety-
 mology, I. pp. 26, 27, s. vv. A für,
 and A ford. See Afdrare.
 agardable. Fr. Awardable. (188.)
 ague pier. Fr. Awhetstone. (601.)
 In former times this was particu-
 larly said to be the due reward
 of him who told the greatest lie ;
 hence, ‘lying for the Whetstone ’
 is a phrase often met with in the
 old writers. The punishment of a
 liar and slanderer, by exhibiting
 him with a Whetstone fastened to
 him, as in the present instance,
 was not unfrequently practised.
 In reference to this notion
 Thomas Randolph says, in p. 37 of
 the Conceited Pedler,—“Consi-
 “ dering how dull halfe the wits
 “ of the University he, I thought
 “ it not the worst tradique to sell
 “ whetstones. This Whetstone
 “ will set an edge upon your in-
 “ ventions, that it will make your
 “ rusty yron braines ﬁner mettle
 “ than your brazen faces. Whet
 “ but the knife of your capacities
 “ on this Whetstone,” etc. Simi-
 larly, upon Sir’ Kenelm Digby
 boasting that he had seen the

 ‘ philosopher’s stone,’ but was un- ,

 able to describe it, Lord Bacon
 sarcastically remarked, that it
 was, perhaps, a Whetstone. See
 also Hudibras, P. II. c. 1. :—

 ‘ Diurnals writ for regulation

 ‘ Of lying to Inform the nation,

 ‘ And by their public use to bring down

 ‘ The rate of Whetstone: in the kingdom .’

 The custom of thus rewarding
 him who told the greatest lie

 aides.

  

 was still existing (according to
 Budworth, Ramble to the Lakes,)
 so late as 1792.
 Fr. plur. (269.) Aids.

 aketoun. Fr. (437.) An acketbn,

 or quilted leather jacket, worn

 ror of the transcriber, no doubt,
 for ‘ Aldermariechurche.’

 Aldermaricherche (619). The

 church of St. Mary Aldermary,
 in Cordwainer StreetWax-d, in the
 City. According to Stow (Sur-
 vey) it was so called, because it
 was older than any other church
 of Saint Mary in the City.

 Aldewyncle (444), Aldwinkle, in

 N orthamptonshire : (a locality
 which, in a later age, is tradi-
 tionally said to have given birth
 to the poet Dryden).

 aldreman (560), aldremans (417),

 aldremens (560). Alderman, al-
 dermen. A French adaptation

 Saxon origin. See Audermann.

 Aldrichegate (106, 586, 682),

 Aldrichesgate (463, 557, 716),
 Aldrichgate (556, 557). Al-
 dersgate, the name of one of the
 London Wards, from the City
 Gate so called. A corruption
 of ‘ Ealdredesgate,’ or ‘ Ealdred's
 ‘ Gate,’ by which name it is

 alose. Fr. A shad. (234, 375).

 Mr. Way informs us (Prompt.

 Parv. 1. p. 310) that it has been
 suggested that the loach (Cobitis I

 barbata, Linn.) may have been
 so named from the old French
 ‘locher,’ to shake, or wag, in
 consequence of its singularly rest-
 less habits. It seems more pro·

 291

 bable, however, that it is a cor-
 ruption, through the French, of
 the Latin ‘alosa’ (as used by
 Ausonius), the more especially
 as the ‘alosa’ is identiﬁed with
 the lya-oh, in the Oreus Vocab.
 (as quoted by Way) ; though, in
 reality, there can be little doubt
 that it originally meant, like the
 present French word, a different
 ﬁsh, the shad.

 bar or hatch, from a bar or gate

 A part of it was early known
 as Hatcham Barnes, possibly
 a corruption of ‘Barre’ or

 of the ancients. The expression
 ‘ pourpre bis,’ for example, he
 takes to mean a purple doubly
 rich. It seems, however, at least
 equally probable that the meaning
 is, a purple shot with a sombre
 colour, brown, black, or grey ;
 similar to the expression “ medley
 “ brune and porre colour ” (what-
 ever ‘porre’ may mean), quoted
 in Herbert’s Hist. Twelve Livery
 Comp. 1. p. 64. The same remark
 will apply to the numerous pas-
 sages quoted by Halliwell, Dict.
 Arch. pp. 177, 178. As to the
 colour called ‘ byce ’ (Prompt.
 Parv. p. 35), or rather ‘ blue byce,’
 Mr. Way is of opinion that it was
 “ a preparation of zaﬁ‘re, of a dim
 “ and brownish cast of colour, in
 “ comparison with the brilliancy
 “ of the true azure.” According to
 a Note in Liber Horn, fol. 249 b..
 ‘ bis’ was a name given to the
 fur on the back of the squirrel iu
 winter, evidently meaning brown.

 308 LIBEB ALBUS.

 Crete (711). The name of a wine,
 imported from the isle of Crete,
 or Candie, in the Middle Ages;
 similar probably to Malvezie,
 and perhaps identical with that
 known as ‘Candie.’ “Vernage
 “ and Crete” are mentioned as
 choice wines in the early Romance
 of Sir Degrevant (Thornton
 Romances, Camd. Soc.), 1. 1407 ;
 also in Colyn Blowbolles Testa-
 ment (MS. Bawl. c. “ Ver-
 “ nuge, Crete, and Raspays also.”
 ——“ Clarett and Creette."—Morte

 n Arthure, MS. Lincoln, f. 55. As
 to the present wine of Candia,
 see Bedding On Wines (Third
 ed.), pp. 25, 291, 292.

 cribre. Fr. (705.) Past participle
 of the verb ‘cribrer,’ to boult,
 or pass through a sieve.

 crie. Fr. A cry, or proclamation.

 crioure. Fr. A crier, one who
 makes proclamation. (310).

 crouse. Fr. A cruse, or small
 drinking-cup. (708.) Early Eng-
 lish forms of this word were
 ‘croise,’ ‘cruce,’ ‘cruise,’ and
 perhaps, ‘cruek’ and ‘crouke.’
 See Cruskyn.

 cruskyn (708). An English form,
 equivalent to the old Fr. ‘ creme-
 ‘ quin,’ a little cruse, or drinking-
 cup. ‘Cruskyn, or cruske, coop
 ‘of erthe.’-Prompt. Par-v. p.
 106; for instances of the early
 use of the word, see Mr. Way’s
 Note to the passage. See C’rouae.

 crute texture. Fr. Raw texture.

  

 (225). Probably the same as
 ‘ cruture ’ and ‘ cruturenne,’ q. v.

 cruture (227), cruturenne (227).

 Fr. Probably a kind of worsted,
 slackly twisted, similar to that
 formerly known in England as
 ‘ crewel,’ and perhaps so called
 from the roughness, or rawness,
 of its texture ; though, according
 to Palsgrave (Eclaircissement,
 1530), ‘ crule ’ was identical with
 ‘ cadas,’ or ‘saijette,’ serge. Ac-
 cording to Roquefort (Gloss.
 Langue Rom. I. p. 326), ‘cms’
 was a name given in the Middle
 Ages tounwr0ught silk. ‘ Cote ’ is
 mentioned as a name for refuse
 wool in Stat. 27 Edw. HI. 3. 8
 (Stat. Realm, 1810, 1. p. 351); but
 that may possibly be an error for
 ‘crote,’ dirty. As to “pannus
 “ crudus,” which seems to have
 been a diﬁ'erent thing, see Madox,
 Firma Burgi, p. 270. See
 Linoges.

 cubibes. Fr. Cubebs. (231).) The

 use of this drug is now solely
 conﬁned to medicine; but in the
 Middle Ages it seems to have
 been used as an article of cookery;
 see the treatise of Walter de
 Biblesworth (Wright’s Vol. Vo-
 cab. p. 174), where it is men-
 tioned as such, under the name of
 ‘ quibibes.’ The “ Piper cubeba”
 and the “Piper canicum " are still
 esteemed as a pleasant condiment
 in Java, their native country.

 cuutre. Fr. A country.

 darrees (266), darres (371, 723).
 Fr. Articles, goods, commodi-
 ties; an early form probably of
 the present Fr. ‘denrees.’ The
 fact mentioned in p. 266 is de-
 serving of notice that, so early as
 the close of the 13th century, thir-
 teen articles went to the baker's
 dozen. See the Glossary to Liber

 to ; but not improbably the ‘Di-
 ‘ nanters,’ or people of Dinant, in
 the province of Namnr, are in-
 tended ; as, according toDr. Lap-
 penberg, at an early period Di-
 nant had an important trade with
 this country, and in the present
 instance would seem to have
 traded in conjunction with the
 Colognese,Whooccupied theirhall.
 Not improbably, also, together
 with the Colognese, at the close
 of the 13th century, they joined
 the Hanseatic League. The “Hall

 or galache, was a kind of patten,
 or shoe with wooden soles, fastened
 to the foot by cross latchets, and
 worn by men, in the 14th cen-

 Chaucer, Squire's Tale, l. 10,869.
 See also the Prompt. Para, p.
 184, and Mr. Way’s Note ; who
 remarks that in the Inventory of
 the eﬁ‘ects of Henry V., taken be-
 fore A. D. 1423, mention is made

 321

 of “one pair of galaches, made of
 “ straw; ” but is at a loss to under-
 stand how straw could be a pro-
 per material for the purpose. The
 fact, however, is, that straw shoes
 are worn in Germany to this day.
 See the Times newspaper of 12th
 December 1859, where mention is
 made of this usage.

 galyhalpeus. Engl. plur. (575.),
 Galley-halfpence ς asmall coin of
 silver. It is said (Stow’s Survey)
 that they were brought by Ge-
 noese merchants, whose galleys
 landed wines and other merchan-
 dize at Galley Quay in Thames
 Street. It seems not improbable,
 however, that they were so called
 from the ﬁgure of a galley im-
 pressed upon them. The circu-
 lation of this coin was forbidden
 in the 13th of Henry IV. and ’
 by Stat. 3 Henry V. c. i.

 a separate hold, granary, or gar-
 ner, for storing corn.

 garson (318, 729, 730), garsoun (47).
 Fr. A journeyman, serving-man,
 or groom. “Garcia, 11. knai'e.”—
 Pict. Vocab. 15th Cent. (Wright’s
 Vol. Vocab. p. 275). Both the
 words ‘knave’ and ‘ groom’ have
 been said to give their origin to
 this word, but query as to this.
 The idea is still extant in our
 word ‘ post-boy,’ a name given to
 a serving-man, who not unfre-
 quently has passed middle age.
 See Garceoun.

 garthman. Engl. (507.) A ‘garth’

 or ‘ﬁshgarthf was a place formed

 at the side of a river, that the

 ﬁsh might be the more easily

 taken; the ‘ garthman ’ being the

 person who farmed it. The word

 “ ‘ garth’ is supposedtobe derived

 “ from the Scottish yart, signify-

 “ ing ‘inforced,’ or ‘c’ompelled,’

 “ the ﬁsh being forced by the

 where the parties, tenant and de-
 mandant, appeared by Scire facias,

 of. See Gaivelete, Gaivelettum,

 gentil. Fr. (453.) As applied to

 dogs, this word may either mean
 such as belong to gentlefolk, or
 else such as are of tame and

 ing projecting from the body of a

 it is said to apply to the ‘ solere,’

 geytes. Fr. Waits, watchmen, or
 individuals forming the City
 Watch. (280. ) In Neckam De
 Uteneilibus (Wright’s Vol. Vocab.
 p. 106 ) they are called ‘veytes,’
 and in the Prompt. Parv.
 ¹ wayte' is rendered “ speculator
 ²⁴ foris ” and “ explorator foris,” a
 ‘ watchman,’ or ‘ looker-out.’
 There seems reason for believing
 that the original ‘waits’ were
 minstrels or musicians, who pa-
 raded the sheets, and sounded the
 Watch on certain wind instru-
 ments, which from them derived
 their name; see Note: and Que-
 ries, 2nd Series, m. pp. 341, 480,
 where the original meaning of
 thi word is largely discussed,
 The “ City Waits ” wore main-
 tained at the expense of the Cor-
 poration, down to a comparatively
 late perriod; and it seems not
 improbable that they were the
 immediate predecessors of the

  

 323

 City trumpeters of more recent
 date. See Gayle, Gait, and
 Wayte.

 gilofre. Fr. plur. Cloves. (230.)

 gingobred. Engl. Gingerbread.(224.)
 It is curious to ﬁnd this article
 named as one of our important
 imports in the 13th century. Not
 improbably, it was extensively
 imported from the Low Countries,
 which are still celebrated for its
 manufacture, Dinant and Louvain
 more especially. See Gynyebraz.

 glacc (230), glasce(224). Fr. Glass.
 It is probably coloured glass that

 is here alluded to; which was .

 extensively imported into this
 country in the Middle Ages ; see

 Glazing; also, Introduction to

 godelmynges. plur. (231.) In a
 similar passage in Liber Horn, a
 Note is added, from which it would
 appear that a ‘godelmynge,’ (or
 ‘ godanesine,’ as it is there cor-
 rected) was cordwain made from
 the skin of a young animal. The
 name apparently is derived from
 Godalming, in Surrey, where the
 trade of tanning is still carried
 on.

 Goderounelane (102). Guthrum’e '

 Lane, now corrupted to “ Gutter
 “ Lane,” in Cheapside. Fine silver
 was called “silver of Guthurun’s

 once appeared, and afterwards
 made default ; in which case this
 Writ was had by common law, in
 lieu of a Petit Cape.

 founded by Henry IIL, though
 not improbably a century earlier.
 The chapel and its appurtenances

 without sufﬁcient authority, to
 all appearance. In Liber Horn

 effect that the Hallmote was so
 called as being a ‘sound’ or ‘ whole'

 Elfrie’s Vocab. and the Anglo-

 Vol. Vocab. pp. 24, 82, 290).
 It has been suggested that this
 word ‘hanap’ is from the German
 ‘ hand’ and ‘napf,’ signifying a
 handled vessel: whereas it appears
 much more probable that it is
 simply a corruption of the A. S.

 ’hmep. The word ‘ hanaper’ too

 has been explained as ‘hand-
 ‘ pannier; ’ whereas it seems much
 more likely that it was originally
 a basket, or hamper, in which
 the hanaps were carried from
 table and perhaps kept. On this
 subject, see Du Gange, Glouar.

 hapertas (225). A eloth of a pecu-

 liar texture, probably coarse and
 thick. It seems not improbable
 that this clothwns identical with
 the ‘ halbeiject,’ or ‘hauberjet,’ the
 uniform breadth of which is
 enacted by c. 34 of the Mayan
 Charta of King John, c. 28 of
 the ﬁrst Magna Charta of Henry
 HL, o. 31 of the second Magna
 Charta of Henry HL, and c. 25
 of the ﬁrst Magna Charta of
 Edward I. The word ‘halber-
 ‘ject,’ it has been suggested, is
 from the German- ‘al,’ ‘all,’ or
 ‘haltz’ or ‘hals,’ ‘the neck,’ and
 ‘bergeu,’ ‘to cover;’ and, as a
 material, it was used for the habits

 . of monks; see Thomson’s Hist.

 the Aseisa de Pond. et Mensur.

 I. pp. 204,—5 ς but seems to differ
 from the present rates; the “ great
 “charreinLondon” being 120 stone
 of 12}ponnds, and elsewhere 2100
 pounds. We learn, on the same
 authority, that according to tron
 weight, the ‘ charre’ was of 2016
 lbs., and that the “charre of the
 “Peak” (as applied to lead, and
 mentioned as a karra in Phillips’s
 World of Words) was less than
 the great ‘charre’ of London.
 Henne, in his Glossary to Long-
 toft’s Chronicle, remarks that the
 old Engl. ‘ karke,’ meaning charge
 or care, is similar to the word
 ‘karke,’ as meaning a load of
 goods; but it seems not impro-
 bable that while the former is
 from the A. S. cape, ‘care,’ the
 latter is a corruption of the A. N.

 “ was a compound of copper,
 “ very much resembling brass,
 “ extensively used in the Middle
 ‘f Ages, but the exact composi-
 “ tion of which seems now not to
 “ be known." Latten was much
 used in the formation of monu-
 mental brasses, and was probably
 extensively imported from Ger-

 (edited for this Series by Mr.

 Indeed, in the Nominale of the

 ‘ mer,’ which means a plank, is
 rendered ‘ a latt.’ The word is
 from the A. S. laetta, or latta
 (Elfric’s Vocab., p. 26 of the
 same volume). According to
 Wilbraham’s Cheshire Glossary

 the word ‘lat’ is still used in

 is always used in a good sense,
 whereas the English word signi-
 ﬁes either praise or dispraise,
 celebrity or notoriety. As mean-
 ing praise, it occurs in the Chro-

 Lussheburghe (57 5). A counterfeit

 These coins had their name, there
 is little doubt, from the fact of
 their being coined at Luxem-
 burgh; the word momma,
 LstNnoa., or LVSEBVRGENSIS,
 forming part of their legend in
 many instances. These spurious

 p. 47. See Lormerie.

 Lymestrete (463). Lime Street
 Ward, in the City. Stowe says
 that the name is from the former

 of the locality, occasioned by the
 brook, known as ‘Langebourne,’
 running through it.

 see the Pinners established in
 London, in the reign of Edward
 III. They also made iron cards,
 for the carding of wool. See
 Cardemaker.

 pyoine. Fr. (224.) The Latin
 word ‘ pinetum ’ is explained as
 “a pyoun” in the Nominale of
 the 15th Ce³ntury (Wright’s Vol.
 Vocab. p. 227); and a ‘pyoun,’
 or ‘pione,’ probably means the
 seed of the piony; formerly used
 as aspice, according to Halliwell,
 Dict. Arch. p. 626. But query as
 to this; for though pungent, these
 seeds are cathartic and emetic.
 ‘Pione ’ seems also to have been a

 queek (606). Probably, a chess-
 board of some description; this
 perhaps being the only instance
 in which it occurs. In Gough’s
 Wardrobe Accounts, 28 Edw. I.
 p. 351, there is an entry, “Lu-
 “dend’ ad creag,” which in the
 Introduction is taken to mean
 cribbage. Again, in Vol. v. of
 the Royal Ordinayfces of France,
 p. 253, art. 3, a very similar
 word, ‘quecce,’ is used as signi-
 fying a barrel for fresh herrings.
 ‘ Quecord’ is mentioned by Halli-
 well, Dict. Arch. p. 657, as a
 game prohibited by an ancient
 Statute, and supposed by Blount
 to be similar to shovel-board. The
 word ‘ chequer ’ is used by Robert
 of Gloucester, 1. 192, to signify
 either the game of chess or the
 chessboard. Not improbably,
 ‘queek’ is a vulgar corruption
 of the word.

 Reynes (231), Reyna (225). The
 French cities of Rheims, in the
 department of Marne, and of
 Rennes, in Britanny, seem to
 have been both known in this
 country by the name of ‘ Rayne,’
 or ‘Reyns;’ thus, in Liberale
 Antiq. Legibus (Camd. Soc.),
 p. 137, “ apud Reyns—fuit in-
 “ unctus in Regem Francorum,”
 --“ was anointed King of the

 Α “ French at Rheims.” The pas-
 sage in Sir Degore (Hist. Engl.
 Poetry, ed. 1840),
 “ Your sheets shalbeof cloths “Rana,”
 is supposed by M. Michel (Re—
 cherche: sur les Etofes de Soie,
 etc. 11. p. 239) to bear reference
 to Rheims ; but Rennes is more
 probably the place meant, as the
 textile manufactures of Rheims
 owe their origin, it is said, to the
 minister Colbert_(though ccrtai nly
 “ serge de Reines ” is mentioned,
 s. a. 1270, in the Memoirs of the
 Sire De J oinville); while Rennes
 was celebrated in the Middle
 Ages, and still is, for its manu-
 factures of ﬁne linen. So “shorts
 “ of Reyns,” and “ Reyna,” are
 mentioned in the Wardrobe Ac-
 counts of 1483, and “ schets of

 " Both the Roche and the Beyn,
 " And the good Human,"

 in the early Romance of Sir De-
 greeant, 11. 1414, 1415 (Thom-
 ton Romances, Camd. Soc.),
 the Rochele wine is not impro-
 bably alluded to; unless indeed
 the red wine of Roche, on the

 Under the name ‘Rochele,’ pes-
 sibly the wine of Rocal, in the

 Romeney (711). A kind of Malm-
 sey; genuine wine under which
 name was imported from Napoli

 “ Malmasyes, Tires, and Ram-
 “ neys ” are wines named in the
 early poem Colyn Blowbollee
 Testament, MS. Rawl. c. 86
 (Thornton Romances, Camd. Soc.
 p. 301). Halliwell describes it
 (Dict. Arch. p. 691), to all ap-
 pearance inaccurately, as a Span-
 ish wine; and quotes the line
 from Wright’s Reliq. Λυκίᾳ,
 “Blut ofAllmaynqromm. and wyin,"—
 from which itwould appear to have
 ranked above ordinary wine ; as
 a kind of liqueur probably. Her-

 scaleoister. A scallop. (275.)
 Probably an early English name,
 from the A. S. feel, “ a shell,” in
 consequence of the superior regu-

 improbable that this is the ﬁsh
 mentioned in Coleridge’s Glos-
 sarial Index, p. 70, under the
 name of ‘ schulle,’ and in Wright’s
 Vol. Vocab. p. 254, as “ch testa,
 “A schylle.” From the Siege qf

 scalters (229), scaltres (179, 229,

 The “nief de scalters,” there can
 be no doubt, was the same as the
 ‘ hocscip,’ or high ship, mentioned
 in pp. 343 and 374, meaning a
 vessel with comparatively high
 sides or bulwarks. It is also
 clearly identical with the ‘ scan-
 ‘dea,’ or “ hante nef,” mentioned in
 Du Cange, Glossar.(ed. Henschel),

 mentioned (s. v.) in the same

 Scawage (225, 229), Scawnnge(234)‚
 Scawenge (223). Engl. Scavage,

 opening out, of imported goods ;
 the same as the ‘ ostensio ’ paid by
 foreign merchants in the Instituta
 Lundom‘a of Ethelred (Thorpe's
 Ancient Laws and Institute: of
 England, p. 127). Spelman, in
 his Glouary, would derive this
 word from an alleged A. S. word
 rceplan; but there can be little

  

 357

 doubt that tho A. S. rccäpmn,
 to look at, view, or search (the
 root of our word ‘ shew’) is the
 basis. In addition to the expla-

 spindeleresbot (374), spindeloresbot
 (343). It seems next to impos-
 sible to identify the vessel thus
 called. It may possibly be the
 ‘litoraria,’ or tpohfcnp (trough-
 ship), or coasting-boat, of Arch-
 bishop }Elfric’s Vocab. (p. 64
 Wright’s Vol. Vocab.); or itmay
 mean a trawling-boat, the net of
 which was drawn up by a wind-
 lass, called a ‘ wyndylle ’ in Pici.
 Vocab. of 15th Century (Wright’s
 Vol. Vocab. p. 275). From the
 nature, however, of the ﬁsh with
 which it was freighted, it seems
 not improbable that this vessel
 was used for ﬁshing in deep sea.

 Staningelane. (115.) Staining Lane,
 in Aldersgate Ward, in the City.
 It is said to have taken its name
 from painters-stainers dwelling
 there; but more probably, from
 the church of St. Mary there
 situate, which may have been
 originally built of stone (elane),
 when others were of wood. See

 steynour. Engl. Astainer. (738.)

 stikelynge. (689.) Probably, a
 stickleback. In an English
 Vocab. of tlte 15th Century
 (Wright’s Vol. Vocab. p. 189),
 the word ‘stytling’ is given as
 the equivalent of ‘scorpio,’ a
 kind of ﬁsh; and is identiﬁed by
 the Editor with the ‘ sticklcback ’
 of the present day. In the No-
 minale of the 15ιή Century (p.

  

 361

 222 of the same Volume), the
 word ‘gamerus’ is rendered a
 ‘ styklynge;’ and in the Prompt.
 Para. the ‘ stykelynge’ is iden-
 tiﬁed with the ‘ silurus ;’ though
 certainly not the ‘silurus’ of
 Pliny, Hist. Nat. B. ix. c. 17.
 Cotgrave renders ‘espinoche’
 (identical with the ‘spinaticus’
 or ‘ ripillio ’ of the Middle Ages),
 “ a sharpling, shaftling, stickling,
 “bankstickle, or sticklebnck.”
 Hence we may conclude it to be
 the ‘stanstikle’ of Neckam De
 Utensilibus (Wright’s Vol. Vocab.
 p. 98); the ‘tantickle’ of the
 Suffolk dialect of the present day.

 stokﬁsshe. Engl. (238, 712.) Stock-

 strik (243), stryk (243). Engl.
 This implement, used for levelling

 362

 corn in the measure, has been
 known in England by various
 other names—“osorium, a stri-
 “kyle,” Nominale of the 15th
 Century (Wright’s Vol. Vocab.
 p. 283); and ‘snitchel,’ Halli-
 well’s Dict. Arch. p. 766 ; such
 method of measuring being called
 “wood and wood,” in R. Holme’s
 Academy, m. p. 377. This mode
 of measuring was rigidly dis-
 tinguished from that by heaped
 or cantel measure: “ Capiatur tol-
 “ netum per rasum, et nihil cum
 “cumulo vel eantallo,”-Staeu-
 tum de Hum-thus, of uncertain
 date (Stat. Realm, 1810, I. p.
 203). See Topham’s Introduc-
 tion to Gough’s Wardrobe Ac-
 counts of 28 Edward I. The
 ‘ strickle’ is so called in England
 at the present day, but in America,
 according to Webster, the word
 ‘strike’ is used. It seems not
 improbable that from the use of

 - this implement a bushel came to be
 called originally a ‘ strike ;’ though
 at a later period a strike sometimes
 meant four bushels, and sometimes
 two. According to Carpentier,
 however (Add. to Du Gauge,
 Glossar), the bushel was thus
 named from an old German word
 ‘strick.’ See Stricum.

 thewe. Engl. (458, 459, 602, 603).
 The thew was a kind of pillory
 used expressly for females;
 though in a document, temp.

 Henry VII., cited by Mr. Way

 in a Note to Prompt. Parv. p.
 282, the ‘thewe’ is apparently
 explained as being “scabellum,

 “ vocatum ‘ a cocking stool.’ ” It
 is on this authority, probably, that

 it is identiﬁed with the cucking-
 stool in Brand’s Popular Antiq.
 m. p. 103 (ed. Ellis). However,
 we learn from Letter-Book H.
 ﬁ‘. 21 and 115, that the thewe
 was a pillory (‘collistrigium’)
 used expressly for women; con-
 sequently, the assertion in the
 Penny Encyclopedia, xvm. p.
 159, that in the Middle Ages
 “women were exempted, on ac-
 “count of their sex, from the
 “ pillory,” is incorrect. This word
 has been said to owe its origin to
 the A. S. poop, a ‘slave,’ as having
 been especially devoted originally
 to the punishment of that class
 of persons; but this assertion is
 no more than a more surmise.
 tholles. Engl. (235.) Tholes, or
 thole-pins, used for rowing a boat.
 Such boats in former times were
 evidently of smaller dimensions

 See Orloh, and Thollce.

 tie. Fr. (279.) A tier, or breadth,
 containing a certain number of
 skins sewed to one another. The
 more usual forms of this word are
 ‘timbre’ and ‘tire ;’ but a more
 common meaning of the latter
 word, as pointed out by M. Michel
 in his Recherche: sur les Elqﬁ'es
 de Soie, etc. 11. pp. 3, 4, is a piece
 of rich cloth; though in some of
 the instances cited by him it may
 possibly mean a ‘length,’ and no
 more. According to the Assisa
 dePond. “Mensur. (Stat. Realm,
 1810, p. 205), the ‘tymbrc,’ or
 ‘ senellio,’ of coney-skins and
 ‘gris,’ contained 10 or 40 skins,
 the reading being uncertain.
 ‘ Tymbres’ of furs are mentioned

 Praeterea, nullus aUutarius nec basanarius de caetero

 voluntate Majoris et communae, et nisi constiterit per
 suiiicientem probationem, ipsum esse bonae famae et
 honestae conversationis, tractabilem, mansuetum, morige-

 sua doctrina xl solidos sterlingorum ad minus; et com-

 ‘mazarg’ anastronomer of the ninth
 century, born at Balkh, in Kho-
 rassan. His principal works are,
 An Introduction to Astronomy,
 and The Book of Conjunction,
 published in a Latin form at
 Augsburg, 1489, and Venice,
 1535.

 allectivus (460). Attracting at-
 tention, attractive.

 maker. See p. 376, ante, s. v.

 allutum (441), alutum (444). Lea-
 ther duly tawed and prepared.
 From p. 442 it would seem that
 inferior leather, such as cow-
 leather and calf-leather, were not
 included under this name.

 Anedehethe (446). From the Note
 in Liber Horn, given in p. 446,
 this appears to have been the
 name of a locality near Westmin-
 ster. Some ‘hithe,’ or landing-
 place, is probably meant; but it
 is perhaps impossible now to
 identify it.

 antiphona (459). In the present
 instance, this word probably
 means, strictly speaking, an ‘ an-

  

 ‘ them ;’ which latter word, like
 the old French ‘anthaine,’ or
 ‘ antoine,’ there can be little
 doubt, is derived from it.

 architriclinus (461). This word is
 used adjectively, as signifying
 “ belonging to the ruler of the
 “ feast ;” in allusion toJolm ii. 9.

 arsmetrica (460). Arithmetic. It
 seems diﬂicultto say whether this
 is a corruption of ‘Aﬁthmeb'ca,’
 or whether it is a compound of
 the Latin words ‘An metrica,’
 the art of measurement. ‘ Ars-
 ‘ metrik,’ as meaning Arithme-
 tic, is used in early English, by
 Lydgate for example.

 See the Glossary to Liber Cus-
 tum. p. 792, s. v. Chirographum.

 trunk-maker ; who, in the present
 instance, seems to have been em-
 ployed in covering boxes with
 cow-leather.

 claia (413, 423), claya (420, 421,
 422, 423). A hurdle. See p.
 304, ante, 3.1:. Claie, and p. 381

 present day contains in some
 places half, in some a quarter of,
 a pint. In the Prompt. Parv. the
 word‘ gylle’is statedtomean only
 a “lytylle pot ;” and, from the
 fact of the use of it being herc

  

 469

 forbidden, it may have contained
 no ﬁxed or deﬁnite measure.

 grangia (451). A grunge, or farm-
 house.

 haberdassher. Engl. (433.) Α
 dealer in haberdashery; which,
 not improbably, if we may judge
 from the present passage,wasori-

 ante, s. o. Hapertas.

 Hedesore (421). Hedsor, a village
 in Buckinghamshire.

 hertliche. Engl. (458.) Heartily.

 hetha (445). A hythe, or landing-
 place.

 hostillarius (425). From the con-
 text, apparently—“ feni, in sig-
 “ num hostillarii,” this does not
 mean ‘hosteler’ in the old sense
 of inn-keeper, but ‘hostler,’ one
 having the charge of his em-
 ployer’s stable.

 hostyller. Engl. (422.) A hosteler,
 or keeper of a hostel, for enter-
 tainment of man and horse.

 huchereve. Engl. (413.) Probably,
 the name given to an inferior

 molendina (421, 422). A mill.

 orlokes. Engl. plur. (447.) See
 p. 344, ante, s. v. Orlok.

 pagina (459). As stated in the
 Note, this is probably an error
 for ‘ machina ,·’ or possibly, it may
 be a corrupt form of the Latin
 word ‘ pegma ’ (derived from the
 Greek), meaning a temporary
 structure of wood.

 parcellus (443). A parcel, or small
 quantity. ‘ Per parcellos ’ (443),
 by retail.

 pixis (432). A box; the term
 ‘ pix ’ being generally limited to
 the coﬂbr in which the conse-

 common for liquid measures of
 wood to be made in this form.
 potagium (451). Pottage, or soup.
 practicatus (462). Contrived.

 quiselli (442). Cuishes, or cuisses;

 salutare Salvation.

 Scawyngha (448). Scavage. See
 p. 401, ante, a. v. Scawanga.

 schopinas (432). Apparently an
 early plural form of the old
 English ‘chopine.’ The “cho-
 ‘ pine ’ was a liquid measure, con-
 taining probably, like the French
 chopine of the present day, one
 pint English; and from it, not
 improbably, is derived our present

  

 GLOSSARY ΤΟ THE APPENDICES.

 English word ‘pint.’ The old
 etymologists have fancifuﬂy de-
 rived the word ‘clcopina’ from
 the Greek χῦειν καὶ πίνειν, “to
 ‘ “ pour out and drink,” as mean-

 ing that it contains as much as
 a man can drink at one draught.
 Menage however thinks, with
 greater probability, that it is a
 corrupt form of ‘euppina,’ the
 diminutive of ‘cuppa,’ ‘a cup.’
 The chopin, still used in Scotland,
 contains one quart English.

 other instances in the City re-
 cords, John Carpenter is found
 thus designated (Letter-Book K.
 ﬂ: 165, 189, Journal No. 3, ﬂ'.
 64, 65). It is remarkable, how-
 ever, that in no other instance
 has the Common Clerk (or Town
 Clerk) of the City of London
 been found thus designated. See
 Brewer’s Memoir of John Car-
 penter, p. 13. '

 ante, s. v. Escout. .

 siligo (451). The grain known by
 this name in the Middle Ages
 was rye; whereas the ‘ siliyo ’ of
 classical writers is thought to

  

 471

 have been either winter-wheat or
 spelt. See Pliny’s Hin. Nat.
 xvm. cc. 19, 20.

 simenel. Engl. (411.) Simnel bread.
